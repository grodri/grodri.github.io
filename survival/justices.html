<h2 id="survival-with-competing-risks">Survival with Competing
Risks</h2>
<p>Singer and Willet (2003) <em>Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis</em>,
Oxford, analyze data on the length of service of U.S. Supreme Court
Justices, treating death and retirement as competing risks, and age at
appointment and calendar year of appointment as predictors.</p>
<p>To conduct a similar analysis I extracted data from Wikipedia and the
Supreme Court website, and prepared a comma-separated-value file with
the justice number, name, and strings representing the dates of birth,
the dates tenure starts and stops, and a status variable that takes the
values Incumbent, Died, Resigned or Retired. I ignore the return
engagements of John Rutledge and Charles Evans Hughes, who resigned and
later were reappointed as Chief Justice.</p>
<p>The file is available on this website as <code>justices.csv</code>
and can be read as shown in the Stata and R logs. All dates include the
day, month and year. The date of birth of James Moore Wayne was
available as year only in both sources, so I set the month and day to
July 1. All other dates were complete. (An earlier version of this
dataset recorded all dates using years only, for simplicity and
consistency with the reference. That version is available in Stata 11
format as <code>justices.dta</code>. It was last updated in 2016.)</p>
<p>We start by reading the data and converting the dates from strings to
the native date format in your statistical package. Note that
<code>stopstr</code> is empty for incumbents. We set it to February 22,
2018 for these cases, effectively censoring the data as of the date this
analysis was run. I calculate <code>tenure</code> in years dividing by
365.25. The <code>event</code> indicator is coded 0 for current
Justices, 1 for those who died while serving, and 2 for those who
resigned or retired. I also compute <code>age</code> at appointment and
<code>year</code> of appointment, and save the dataset for later
use.</p>

<h3 id="the-status-plot">The Status Plot</h3>
<p>We now build a nice plot that combines the Kaplan-Meier estimate of
overall attrition with the cumulative incidence functions showing
atrition by cause. This takes a bit of work, but I think the result is
worth the effort.</p>
<p>We use the fact that the survival and incidence functions add up to
one, <em>S(t) + I1(t) + I2(t) = 1</em>, so the areas in the plot have
boundaries <em>1, 1 - I1(t), S(t)</em> and <em>0</em>. The survival can
be obtained from Kaplan-Meier or as the complement of the sum of the
incidence functions.</p>
<p><span class="stata">In Stata we start by extracting the CIF for
death, and fill in the times for other types of events, which are coded
as missing. We also add a dummy observation so the plot actually starts
at time 0.</span></p>

<p>The green area is the survival function, showing the probability of
remaining in the court, and the other two areas partition attrition into
death and retirement, based on the incidence functions. In the long run
death and retirement are approximately equally likely.</p>

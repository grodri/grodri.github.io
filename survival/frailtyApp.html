<p>Hereâ€™s an illustration of what happens to a proportional hazards
model when we add unobserved heterogeneity. We consider two groups where
the subject-specific survival is exponential with constant hazards of 1
and 2. By moving the slider you can add gamma-distributed unobserved
heterogeneity with a variance between 0 and 0.5.</p>

<p>You will notice that as the variance of frailty increases the
population-average hazards drop below the subject-specific hazards,
reflecting selection. Moreover, the effect is more pronounced in the
group with higher initial risk. As a result, the proportional hazards
model no longer holds.</p>
<p>The lesson here is that with single-failure data we cannot
distinguish duration dependence or non-proportional effects from
unobserved heterogeneity.</p>

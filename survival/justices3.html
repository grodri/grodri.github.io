<p>We conclude our competing risk analysis of supreme court tenure by
fitting the Fine and Gray model, which focuses on the sub-hazard of each
risk.</p>
<p>We use the file saved earlier, <a href="justices">see</a>.
Alternatively, you may rebuild the dataset using the first block of code
in that page.</p>

{% include srtabs.html %}

<p>We read the data and recode dates as before. (You can skip this step

<p>We see that the probability that a judge will die while in the court
doesn’t appear to vary with age at appointment, but decreases with
calendar year of appointment, so judges appointed more recently are less
likely to die while serving in the court.</p>

<p>We see that the probability of dying while serving in the court is
declining over time net of age at appointment. For a justice appointed
at age 55, the probability would be 31.6% if appointed in 1950 and 22.0%
if appointed in the year 2000, assuming of course that current trends
continue, so the model applies.</p>
<p>Incidence functions can also be computed from Cox models, which in my
view have a clearer interpretation, as shown <a
href="justices2">here</a>. The Cox proportional hazards approach leads
to estimated probabilities of death of 32.8% if appointed in 1950 and
22.6% if appointed in 2000. Both methods agree in estimating the overall
decline as about ten percentage points.</p>

<p>The figure below shows age-specific mortality rates for black and
white males using U.S. data from 2002. You will notice that the
population-average hazard is higher for blacks fror every age up to 87,
but then the curves cross over.</p>
<p>To illustrate how this type of pattern could be the result of
unobserved heterogeneity I will treat these synthetic-cohort rates as if
they applied to real heterogeneous cohorts where frailty has a gamma
distribution. The initial curves use homogeneous cohorts, but using the
slider you can change the variance of heterogeneity from 0 to 1.</p>

<p>You will notice that increasing heterogeneity eventually leads to the
subject-specific hazard curves to uncross, showing that the observed
pattern could result from black males experiencing more selection as a
result of higher mortality rates. However, the variance needed to remove
the crossover is very high. An alternative explanation may lie in age
misreporting.</p>

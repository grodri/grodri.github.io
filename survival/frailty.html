<h2 id="a-shared-frailty-model">A Shared Frailty Model</h2>
<p>We will show how to fit a shared frailty model using data on child
mortality in Guatemala. The data come from a retrospective survey
conducted in 1974-76 by the <em>Instituto de Nutrición de Centroamérica
y Panamá</em> (INCAP) and RAND, and include data on multiple children
per family.</p>
<p>The data were first analyzed ignoring the clustering by Pebley and
Stupp (1987) Reproductive Patterns and Child Mortality in Guatemala.
<em>Demography</em>,24:43-60 <a
href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2061507">[1]</a>. (This link requires
access to JSTOR.)</p>
<p>The data were then reanalized by Guo and Rodríguez (1992), Estimating
a Multivariate Proportional Hazards Model for Clustered Data Using the
EM Algorithm, with an Application to Child Survival in Guatemala,
<em>Journal of the American Statistical Association</em>, 87:969-976 <a
href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2290633">[2]</a>, using what we now
call a shared frailty model.</p>
<p>The dataset is available as a Stata file in long format (one record
per child):</p>

<p>The first step is to reproduce exactly the results in Pebley and
Stupp. We start by <code>stset</code>ing the data, noting that
<code>time</code>’ is age at death or at interview, <code>death</code>
is an indicator of whether the child died, and <code>kidid</code>’
uniquely identifies each kid. (This is 10 times the <code>momid</code>
in the original dataset plus the kid number.)</p>

<p>Pebley and Stupp used a piece-wise exponential model where the hazard
is constant in intervals with boundaries at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months. We
can fit that kind of model in Stata using the standard Poisson trick, or
using <code>streg</code>’ to fit an exponential model with dummy
variables for the duration categories. We will do the latter because it
allows us to introduce gamma frailty later. So we <code>stsplit</code>
the dataset and generate dummies for all categories. (Note that the
original paper shows the hazard for each age, so we generate dummies for
all age categories and omit the constant.)</p>
<pre class='stata'>. stsplit dur, at(0 1 6 12 24 60)
(10,474 observations (episodes) created)

. gen a0      = dur==0

. gen a1to5   = dur==1

. gen a6to11  = dur==6

. gen a12to23 = dur==12

. gen a24up   = dur==24

. local age "a0 a1to5 a6to11 a12to23 a24up"
</pre>
<p>The model includes mother’s age and age squared, a linear term on
birth order, and an indicator of whether the previous kid in the family
died. There are also indicators for the length of the previous birth
interval with categories 0-14, 15-23, 24-35 and 36 or more, with first
births serving as the reference cell. We need to compute only one of
these variables. It is useful to create macros for all:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. gen mage2 = mage^2

. local fixed "mage mage2 borde pdead"

. local previous "p0014 p1523 p2435 p36up"
</pre>
<p>The model also includes a time-varying covariate with time-varying
effects. The variable in question is the length of the following birth
interval, with indicators <code>f0011</code>’ for intervals under a year
and <code>f1223</code>’ for intervals of one to two years. These dummies
capture very short and short intervals, where a child would face
competition from a subsequent sibling. Pebley and Stupp treat these as
time-varying covariates because a sibling is assumed to affect the life
of the index child only after it is born. So we consider very short
intervals (&lt; 12) only at ages 12 months and higher, and short
intervals (12-23 months) only at ages 24 months and higher. This is the
time-varying part. But the effect of very short intervals is also
allowed to vary, with intervals &lt; 12 having different effects at ages
12-23 and 24 or more. This means that we need to create three variables
that interact the length of the following interval with the age of the
child:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. gen i011a1223 = f0011 * (dur == 12)

. gen i011a24p  = f0011 * (dur == 24)

. gen i1223a24p = f1223 * (dur == 24)

. local follow "i011a1223 i011a24p i1223a24p"
</pre>
<p>We are now ready to fit the model. You should verify that this
reproduces exactly the results in Pebley and Stupp, which is quite
remarkable.</p>

<p>We now introduce a shared frailty term at the mother’s level to allow
for intra-family correlation in child survival. Following standard
practice, we assume that the frailty term has a gamma distribution
independent of observed covariates. Guo and Rodriguez derive an EM
algorithm to fit this model (and Guo’s dissertation includes the Fortran
program used to fit the model). I now show how to reproduce their
results using <code>streg</code>. All we need to do is specify the
frailty distribution and the variable that identifies the clusters:</p>

<p>You may verify that the results agree quite closely with the paper.
(The labels for the complex interaction terms involving the following
birth interval are out of order in the published paper, but OK in Guo’s
dissertation.)</p>
<p>The estimated variance of frailty of 0.21 (or 0.22 in the paper)
implies modest association between the lifetimes of siblings. Following
Oakes, it corresponds to a rank correlation of 0.09. Even this small
association, however, translates into substantial hazard ratios in the
sense of Clayton. The conditional hazard for a child knowing that a
sibling died at age a is 22% higher than if the sibling survived to age
<em>a</em>, holding all covariates constant. Knowing that two siblings
died raises the hazard by 44%. Note that to test the significance of the
variance we have to be careful because the test is on a boundary of the
parameter space. In the JASA paper we obtain a t-ratio of 1.6 for the
variance, which agrees with Stata (0.214/0.135 = 1.6, although working
in the log-scale would be better). Stata’s likelihood ratio test gives a
chi-squared of 3.3 with an estimated p-value of 0.035, essentially the
same result.</p>

<p>The other aspect of interest in the results is that the estimates of
the covariate effects are remarkably stable. The one change worth
mentioning is the coefficient for ‘previous child died’, which changes
sign. This variable was clearly acting as a proxy for unobserved family
effects. Note also that the t-ratios for observed covariate effects have
generally declined in magnitude, which is consistent with the notion
that correlated observations have less information than independent
observations.</p>
<p>Guo and Rodríguez also fit a non-parametric frailty model using a
two-point distribution. This distribution is not built into Stata, but
the model can be fit in Stata with only modest effort by following the
method described in Section 3.2 of the paper. Details are left as an
exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>We continue our analysis of this dataset with a discussion of <a
href="frailty2">model interpretation</a>, including calculation of
predicted risks and probabilities.</p>

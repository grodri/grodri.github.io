*Note*. The computing logs were all produced using the `markstat` command to combine
Markdown with Stata and R, as described [here](https://grodri.github.io/markstat),
see also [this example](https://grodri.github.io/markstat/stata-r-tabs). 
All the scripts are available on GitHub, just follow the link on each page.

<h2>6. Multinomial Response Models</h2>
<p>We now turn our attention to regression models for the analysis of categorical dependent variables
with more than two response categories.  Several of the models that we will study may be considered
generalizations of logistic regression analysis to polychotomous data.  We first consider models
that may be used with purely qualitative or <i>nominal</i> data, and then move on to models for 
<i>ordinal</i> data, where the response categories are ordered.</p>

<h3>6.1 The Nature of Multinomial Data</h3>
<p>Let me start by introducing a simple dataset that will be used
to illustrate the multinomial distribution and
multinomial response models.</p>

<h4>6.1.1 The Contraceptive Use Data</h4>
<p>Table <a href='#t_6_1'>6.1</a> was reconstructed from weighted percents found in
Table 4.7 of the final report of
the Demographic and Health Survey conducted in
El Salvador in 1985 (FESAL-1985). The table shows 3165
currently married women classified by age, grouped in
five-year intervals, and current use of contraception,
classified as sterilization, other methods, and no method.</p>

<p>A fairly standard approach to the analysis of data of this type
could treat the two variables as responses and proceed to
investigate the question of independence. For these
data the hypothesis of independence is soundly rejected, with
a likelihood ratio \( \chi^2 \) of 521.1 on 12 d.f.</p>

<p>In this chapter we will view contraceptive use as the
response and age as a predictor.
Instead of looking at the joint distribution of the two variables,
we will look at the conditional distribution of the
response, contraceptive use, given the predictor, age.
As it turns out, the two approaches are intimately related.</p>

<h4>6.1.2 The Multinomial Distribution</h4>
<p>Let us review briefly the multinomial distribution that we
first encountered in Chapter 5.
Consider a random variable \( Y_i \) that may take one of several
discrete values, which we index \( 1, 2, \ldots, J \). In the
example the response is contraceptive use and it takes the
values &lsquo;sterilization&rsquo;, &lsquo;other method&rsquo; and &lsquo;no method&rsquo;, which
we index 1, 2 and 3. Let</p>

\[\tag{6.1}\pi_{ij} = \mbox{Pr}\{ Y_i = j \}\]
<p>denote the probability that the \( i \)-th response falls in the
\( j \)-th category. In the example \( \pi_{i1} \) is the probability
that the \( i \)-th respondent is &lsquo;sterilized&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Assuming that the response categories are mutually exclusive
and exhaustive, we have \( \sum_{j=1}^J \pi_{ij} = 1 \) for each \( i \),
i.e.&nbsp;the probabilities add up to one for each individual,
and we have only \( J-1 \) parameters. In the example, once we
know the probability of &lsquo;sterilized&rsquo; and of &lsquo;other method&rsquo;
we automatically know by subtraction the probability of
&lsquo;no method&rsquo;.</p>

<p>For <i>grouped data</i> it will be convenient to introduce auxiliary
random variables representing counts of responses in the various categories.
Let \( n_i \) denote the number of cases in the \( i \)-th group
and let \( Y_{ij} \) denote the number of responses
from the \( i \)-th group that fall in the \( j \)-th category,
with observed value \( y_{ij} \).</p>

<p>In our example \( i \) represents
age groups, \( n_i \) is the number of women in the \( i \)-th age group,
and \( y_{i1}, y_{i2}, \) and \( y_{i3} \) are the numbers of women
sterilized, using another method, and using no method, respectively,
in the \( i \)-th age group.
Note that \( \sum_j y_{ij} = n_i \), i.e.&nbsp;the counts in the
various response categories add up to the number of cases in each age group.</p>

<p>For <i>individual data</i> \( n_i=1 \) and \( Y_{ij} \) becomes an indicator
(or dummy) variable that takes the value
\( 1 \) if the \( i \)-th response falls in the \( j \)-th category
and \( 0 \) otherwise, and \( \sum_j y_{ij} = 1 \), since one
and only one of the indicators \( y_{ij} \) can be &lsquo;on&rsquo; for each case.
In our example we could work with the 3165 records in the individual
data file and let \( y_{i1} \) be one if the \( i \)-th woman is sterilized
and 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>The probability distribution of the counts
\( Y_{ij} \) given the total \( n_i \) is given by the
<i>multinomial</i> distribution</p>

<a name='e_6_2'></a>\[\tag{6.2}\mbox{Pr}\{Y_{i1}=y_{i1}, \ldots, Y_{iJ}=y_{iJ} \} =
 {n_i \choose y_{i1}, \ldots, y_{iJ} }
\pi_{i1}^{y_{i1}} \ldots \pi_{iJ}^{y_{iJ}}\]
<p>The special
case where \( J=2 \) and we have only two response categories
is the binomial distribution of Chapter 3. To verify this
fact equate \( y_{i1}=y_i \), \( y_{i2}=n_i-y_i \), \( \pi_{i1}=\pi_i \),
and \( \pi_{i2} = 1-\pi_i \).</p>

<h3>3.5 Models With Two Predictors</h3>
<p>We now consider models involving two predictors, and discuss the
binary data analogues of two-way analysis of variance,
multiple regression with dummy variables, and analysis of
covariance models. An important element of the discussion
concerns the key concepts of main effects and interactions.</p>

<h4>3.5.1 Age and Preferences</h4>
<p>Consider the distribution of contraceptive use by age and
desire for more children, as summarized in Table <a href='#t_3_7'>3.7</a>.
We have a total of eight groups, which will be indexed by
a pair of subscripts \( i,j \), with \( i=1,2,3,4 \) referring to
the four age groups and \( j=1,2 \) denoting the two categories
of desire for more children. We let \( y_{ij} \) denote the number
of women using contraception and \( n_{ij} \) the total number of
women in age group \( i \) and category \( j \) of desire for more children.</p>

<a name='t_3_7'></a><p class='text-center'>Table 3.7. Contraceptive Use by Age and Desire for More Children</p>
<table class='tex-table'>
<tr class='bt'><td class='al'>Age</td><td class='al'>Desires</td><td class='ar'>Using</td><td class='ar'>Not Using</td><td class='ar'>All</td></tr>
<tr class='bb'><td class='al'>\(i\)</td><td class='al'>\(j\)</td><td class='ar'>\(y_{ij}\)</td><td class='ar'>\(n_{ij}-y_{ij}\)</td><td class='ar'>\(n_{ij}\)</td></tr>
<tr class='bt'><td class='al'>\(<\)25</td><td class='al'>Yes</td><td class='ar'>58</td><td class='ar'>265</td><td class='ar'>323</td></tr>
<tr><td class='al'></td><td class='al'>No</td><td class='ar'>14</td><td class='ar'>60</td><td class='ar'>74</td></tr>

<tr class='bt bb'><td class='al'>Total</td><td class='al'></td><td class='ar'>507</td><td class='ar'>1100</td><td class='ar'>1607</td></tr>
</table>

<p>We now analyze these data under the usual assumption of a binomial
error structure, so the \( y_{ij} \) are viewed as realizations of
independent random variables \( Y_{ij} \sim B(n_{ij}, \pi_{ij}) \).</p>

<h4>3.5.2 The Deviance Table</h4>
<p>There are five basic models of interest for the systematic structure
of these data, ranging from the null to the saturated model.
These models are listed in Table <a href='#t_3_8'>3.8</a>, which
includes the name of the model,
a descriptive notation,
the formula for the linear predictor,
the deviance or
goodness of fit likelihood ratio chi-squared statistic, and
the degrees of freedom.</p>

<p>Note first that the null model does not fit the data: the deviance of
145.7 on 7 d.f.&nbsp;is much greater than 14.1, the 95-th percentile of
the chi-squared distribution with 7 d.f.
This result is not surprising, since we already knew that contraceptive
use depends on desire for more children and varies by age.</p>

<a name='t_3_8'></a><p class='text-center'>Table 3.8. Deviance Table for Models of Contraceptive Use<br/>by Age (Grouped) and Desire for More Children</p>

<tr><td class='al'>Age</td><td class='al'>\(A\)</td><td class='al'>\(\eta + \alpha_i\)</td><td class='ar'>66.5</td><td class='ar'>4</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Introducing age in the model reduces the deviance to 66.5 on four d.f.
The difference in deviances between the null model and the age model
provides a test for the <i>gross</i> effect of age.
The difference is 79.2 on three d.f., and is highly significant.
This value is exactly the same that we obtained in the previous section,
when we tested for an age effect using the data classified by age only.
Moreover, the estimated age effects based on fitting the age model
to the three-way classification in Table <a href='#t_3_7'>3.7</a>
would be exactly the same as those estimated in the previous section,
and have the property of reproducing exactly the proportions using
contraception in each age group.</p>

<p>This equivalence illustrate an important property of binomial models.
All information concerning the gross effect of age on contraceptive
use is contained in the marginal distribution of contraceptive use
by age. We can work with the data classified by age only,
by age and desire for more children,
by age, education and desire for more children,
or even with the individual data.
In all cases the estimated effects, standard errors, and likelihood
ratio tests based on differences between deviances will be the same.</p>

<p>The deviances themselves will vary, however, because they depend on the
context. In the previous section the deviance of the age model was
zero, because treating age as a factor reproduces exactly the
proportions using contraception by age.
In this section the deviance of the age model is 66.5 on four d.f.
and is highly significant, because the age model does not
reproduce well the table of contraceptive use by both age and
preferences.
In both cases, however, the difference in deviances between
the age model and the null model is 79.2 on three d.f.</p>

<p>The next model in Table <a href='#t_3_8'>3.8</a> is the model with a main effect
of desire for more children, and has a deviance of 54.0 on six d.f.
Comparison of this value with the deviance of the null model
shows a gain of 97.1 at the expense of one d.f., indicating a
highly significant <i>gross</i> effect of desire for more
children.  This is, of course, the same result that we obtained in
Section 3.3, when we first looked at contraceptive use by desire
for more children. Note also that this model does not fit the
data, as it own deviance is highly significant.</p>

<p>The fact that the effect of desire for more children has a chi-squared
statistic of 91.7 with only one d.f., whereas age gives 79.2 on
three d.f., suggests that desire for more children has a stronger
effect on contraceptive use than age does. Note, however, that the
comparison is informal; the models are not nested, and therefore we
cannot construct a significance test from their deviances.</p>

<h4>3.5.3 The Additive Model</h4>
<p>Consider now the two-factor additive model, denoted \( A+D \) in
Table <a href='#t_3_8'>3.8</a>. In this model the logit of the probability of
using contraception in age group \( i \) and in category \( j \) of desire for
more children is</p>

\[ \mbox{logit}(\pi_{ij}) = \eta + \alpha_i + \beta_j, \]
<p>where \( \eta \) is a constant, the \( \alpha_i \) are age effects and the
\( \beta_j \) are effects of desire for more children.
To avoid redundant parameters we adopt the reference cell
method and set \( \alpha_1 = \beta_1 = 0 \). The parameters may then be
interpreted as follows:</p>

<table class="tex-list"><tr><td>\(\eta\)</td><td>
 is the logit of the probability of using contraception for women under 25
who want more children, who serve as the reference cell,
</tr></tr><tr><td>\(\alpha_i\)</td><td>
 for \(i=2,3,4\) represents the
<i> net</i> effect of ages 25&ndash;29, 30&ndash;39 and 40&ndash;49, compared to
women under age 25 in the same category of desire for more children,
</tr></tr><tr><td>\(\beta_2\)</td><td>
 represents the <i> net</i> effect of wanting no more children,
compared to women who want more children in the same age group.
</tr></tr></table>
<p>The model is additive in the logit scale, in the usual sense that the
effect of one variable does not depend on the value of the other.
For example, the effect of desiring no more children is \( \beta_2 \) in all
four age groups. (This assumption must obviously be tested, and we
shall see that it is not consistent with the data.)</p>

<p>The deviance of the additive model is 16.8 on three d.f.
With this value we can calculate three different tests of interest,
all of which involve comparisons between nested models.</p>

<ul><li><p>
As we move from model \(D\) to \(A+D\) the deviance decreases by 37.2 while
we lose three d.f.
This statistic tests the hypothesis \(H_0: \alpha_i=0\) for all \(i\),
concerning the <i> net</i> effect of age
after adjusting for desire for more children, and is highly significant.
</p></li><li><p>
As we move from model \(A\) to \(A+D\) we reduce the deviance by 49.7 at the
expense of one d.f.  This chi-squared statistic tests the hypothesis
\(H_0: \beta_2=0\) concerning the <i> net</i> effect of desire for
more children after adjusting for age. This value is highly significant,
so we reject the hypothesis of no net effects.
</p></li><li><p>
Finally, the deviance of 16.8 on three d.f. is a measure of goodness of
fit of the additive model: it compares this model with the saturated model,
which adds an interaction between the two factors. Since the deviance
exceeds 11.3, the one-percent critical value in the chi-squared distribution for
three d.f., we conclude that the additive model fails to fit
the data.
</p></li></ul>
<p>Table <a href='#t_3_9'>3.9</a> shows parameter estimates for the additive model.
We show briefly how they would be interpreted, although we have evidence
that the additive model does not fit the data.</p>

<a name='t_3_9'></a><p class='text-center'>Table 3.9. Parameter Estimates for Additive Logit Model of<br/>Contraceptive Use by Age (Grouped) and Desire for Children</p>
<table class='tex-table'>

<tr class='bt'><td colspan='2' align='left'>Constant</td><td class='al'>\(\eta\)</td><td class='ar'>\(-\)1.694</td><td class='ar'>0.135</td><td class='ar'>\(-\)12.53</td></tr>
<tr><td class='al'>Age</td><td class='al'>25&ndash;29</td><td class='al'>\(\alpha_2\)</td><td class='ar'>0.368</td><td class='ar'>0.175</td><td class='ar'>2.10</td></tr>
<tr><td class='al'></td><td class='al'>30&ndash;39</td><td class='al'>\(\alpha_3\)</td><td class='ar'>0.808</td><td class='ar'>0.160</td><td class='ar'>5.06</td></tr>
<tr><td class='al'></td><td class='al'>40&ndash;49</td><td class='al'>\(\alpha_4\)</td><td class='ar'>1.023</td><td class='ar'>0.204</td><td class='ar'>5.01</td></tr>
<tr class='bb'><td class='al'>Desire</td><td class='al'>No</td><td class='al'>\(\beta_2\)</td><td class='ar'>0.824</td><td class='ar'>0.117</td><td class='ar'>7.04</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The estimates of the \( \alpha_j \)&rsquo;s  show a monotonic effect of age on
contraceptive use. Although there is evidence that this effect may
vary depending on whether women desire more children, on average the
odds of using contraception among women age 40 or higher are nearly three
times the corresponding odds among women under age 25 in the same
category of desire for another child.</p>

<p>Similarly, the estimate of \( \beta_2 \) shows
a strong effect of wanting no more children. Although there is evidence
that this effect may depend on the woman&rsquo;s age, on average the odds of using
contraception among women who desire no more children are more than
double the corresponding odds among women in the same age group
who desire another child.</p>

<h4>3.5.4 A Model With Interactions</h4>
<p>We now consider a model which includes an interaction of age
and desire for more children, denoted \( A D \) in Table <a href='#t_3_8'>3.8</a>.
The model is</p>

\[ \mbox{logit}(\pi_{ij}) = \eta + \alpha_i + \beta_j + (\alpha\beta)_{ij}, \]
<p>where \( \eta \) is a constant, the \( \alpha_i \) and \( \beta_j \) are the
main effects of age and desire, and \( (\alpha\beta)_{ij} \) is the
interaction effect.
To avoid redundancies we follow the reference cell method and set
to zero all parameters involving the first cell, so that
\( \alpha_1 = \beta_1 = 0 \), \( (\alpha\beta)_{1j} = 0 \) for all \( j \)
and \( (\alpha\beta)_{i1} = 0 \) for all \( i \). The remaining parameters
may be interpreted as follows:</p>

<table class="tex-list"><tr><td>\(\eta\)</td><td>
is the logit of the reference group: women under age 25 who desire
more children.
</tr></tr><tr><td>\(\alpha_i\)</td><td>
 for \(i=2,3,4\) are the effects of the age groups
25&ndash;29, 30&ndash;39 and 40&ndash;49, compared to ages under 25,
for women who want another child.
</tr></tr><tr><td>\(\beta_2\)</td><td>
 is the effect of desiring no more children, compared to
wanting another child, for women under age 25.
</tr></tr><tr><td>\((\alpha\beta)_{i2}\)</td><td>
 for \(i=2,3,4\) is the <i> additional</i> effect of
desiring no more children, compared to wanting another child,
for women in age group \(i\) rather than under age 25.
(This parameter is also the <i> additional</i> effect of age group
\(i\), compared to ages under 25,
for women who desire no more children rather than those who want more.)
</tr></tr></table>
<p>One way to simplify the presentation of results involving interactions
is to combine the interaction terms with one of the main effects,
and present them as effects of one factor within categories or
levels of the other. In our example, we can combine the
interactions \( (\alpha\beta)_{i2} \) with the main effects
of desire \( \beta_2 \), so that</p>

<table class="tex-list"><tr><td>\(\beta_2\) + \((\alpha\beta)_{i2}\)</td><td>
 is the effect of desiring no more children,
compared to wanting another child, for women in age group \(i\).
</tr></tr></table>
<p>Of course, we could also combine the interactions with the main
effects of age, and speak of age effects which are specific to women in each
category of desire for more children.
The two formulations are statistically equivalent, but the one chosen
here seems demographically more sensible.</p>

<p>To obtain estimates based on this parameterization of the model we have
to define the columns of the model matrix as follows. Let \( a_i \) be a
dummy variable representing age group \( i \), for \( i=2,3,4 \), and let \( d \)
take the value one for women who want no more children and zero
otherwise. Then the model matrix \( \boldsymbol{X} \) should have a column of ones to
represent the constant or reference cell, the age dummies \( a_2, a_3 \)
and \( a_4 \) to represent the age effects for women in the reference cell,
and then the dummy \( d \) and the products \( a_2 d, a_3 d \) and \( a_4 d \), to
represent the effect of wanting no more children at ages \( <25 \), 25&ndash;29,
30&ndash;39 and 40&ndash;49, respectively. The resulting estimates and standard
errors are shown in Table <a href='#t_3_10'>3.10</a>.</p>

<a name='t_3_10'></a><p class='text-center'>Table 3.10. Parameter Estimates for Model of Contraceptive Use With an<br/>Interaction Between Age (Grouped) and Desire for More Children</p>

</table>

<p>The results indicate that contraceptive use among women who
desire more children varies little by age, increasing up to
age 35&ndash;39 and then declining somewhat.
On the other hand, the effect of wanting no more children
increases dramatically with age, from no effect among
women below age 25 to an odds ratio of 4.18 at ages 40&ndash;49.
Thus, in the older cohort the odds of
using contraception among women who want no more children
are four times the corresponding odds among women who
desire more children.
The results can also be summarized by noting that
contraceptive use for spacing (i.e. among women who desire
more children) does not vary much by age, but
contraceptive use for limiting fertility (i.e among women
who want no more children) increases sharply with age.</p>

<h4>3.5.5 Analysis of Covariance Models</h4>
<p>Since the model with an age by desire interaction is saturated,
we have essentially reproduced the observed data.
We now consider whether we could attain a more parsimonious
fit by treating age as a variate and desire for more children
as a factor, in the spirit of covariance analysis models.</p>

<p>Table <a href='#t_3_11'>3.11</a> shows deviances for three models that
include a linear effect of age using, as before, the midpoints
of the age groups.
To emphasize this point we use \( X \) rather than \( A \) to denote age.</p>

<a name='t_3_11'></a><p class='text-center'>Table 3.11. Deviance Table for Models of Contraceptive Use<br/>by Age (Linear) and Desire for More Children</p>
<table class='tex-table'>
<tr class='bt bb'><td class='al'>Model</td><td class='al'>Notation</td><td class='al'>\(\mbox{logit}(\pi_{ij})\)</td><td class='ar'>Deviance</td><td class='ar'>d.f.</td></tr>
<tr class='bt'><td class='al'>One Line</td><td class='al'>\(X\)</td><td class='al'>\(\alpha  +\beta   x_i\)</td><td class='ar'>68.88</td><td class='ar'>6</td></tr>
<tr><td class='al'>Parallel Lines</td><td class='al'>\(X+D\)</td><td class='al'>\(\alpha_j+\beta   x_i\)</td><td class='ar'>18.99</td><td class='ar'>5</td></tr>
<tr class='bb'><td class='al'>Two Lines</td><td class='al'>\(X D\)</td><td class='al'>\(\alpha_j+\beta_j x_i\)</td><td class='ar'>9.14</td><td class='ar'>4</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The first model assumes that the logits are linear functions of
age. This model fails to fit the data, which is not surprising
because it ignores desire for more children, a factor that has
a large effect on contraceptive use.</p>

<p>The next model, denoted \( X+D \), is analogous to the two-factor additive
model. It allows for an effect of desire for more children which is the
same at all ages.  This common effect is modelled by allowing each
category of desire for more children to have its own constant, and
results in two parallel lines. The common slope is the effect of age
within categories of desire for more children. The reduction in
deviance of 39.9 on one d.f.&nbsp;indicates that desire for no more children
has a strong effect on contraceptive use after controlling for a linear
effect of age. However, the attained deviance of 19.0 on five d.f.&nbsp;is
significant, indicating that the assumption of two parallel lines is
not consistent with the data.</p>

<p>The last model in the table, denoted \( X D \), includes an interaction
between the linear effect of age and desire, and thus allows the effect
of desire for more children to vary by age. This variation is modelled
by allowing each category of desire for more children to have its own
slope in addition to its own constant, and results in two regression
lines.  The reduction in deviance of 9.9 on one d.f.&nbsp;is a test of the
hypothesis of parallelism or common slope \( H_0: \beta_1=\beta_2 \), which
is rejected with a P-value of 0.002. The model deviance of 9.14 on four
d.f.&nbsp;is just below the five percent critical value of the chi-squared
distribution with four d.f., which is 9.49. Thus, we have no evidence
against the assumption of two straight lines.</p>

<p>Before we present parameter estimates we need to discuss briefly the
choice of parameterization. Direct application of the reference cell
method leads us to use four variables: a dummy variable always equal to
one, a variable \( x \) with the mid-points of the age groups, a dummy
variable \( d \) which takes the value one for women who want no more
children, and a variable \( d x \) equal to the product of this dummy by
the mid-points of the age groups. This choice leads to parameters
representing the constant and slope for women who want another child,
and parameters representing the <i>difference</i> in constants and
slopes for women who want no more children.</p>

<p>An alternative is to simply report the constants and slopes for the two
groups defined by desire for more children. This parameterization can
be easily obtained by omitting the constant and using the following
four variables: \( d \) and \( 1-d \) to represent the two constants and \( d x \)
and \( (1-d)x \) to represent the two slopes. One could, of course, obtain
the constant and slope for women who want no more children from the
previous parameterization simply by adding the main effect and the
interaction. The simplest way to obtain the standard errors, however,
is to change parameterization.</p>

<p>In both cases the constants represent effects at age zero and are not
very meaningful. To obtain parameters that are more directly
interpretable, we can center age around the sample mean, which is 30.6
years.  Table <a href='#t_3_12'>3.12</a> shows parameter estimates obtained under
the two parameterizations discussed above, using the mid-points of the
age groups minus the mean.</p>

<a name='t_3_12'></a><p class='text-center'>Table 3.12. Parameter Estimates for Model of Contraceptive Use With an<br/>Interaction Between Age (Linear) and Desire for More Children</p>

</table>

<p>Thus, we find that contraceptive use increases with age, but at a
faster rate among women who want no more children. The estimated
slopes correspond to increases in the odds of two and seven percent
per year of age for women who want and do not want more children,
respectively. The difference of the slopes is significant by
a likelihood ratio test or by Wald&rsquo;s test, with a \( z \)-ratio
of 3.11.</p>

<p>Similarly, the effect of wanting no more children increases
with age. The odds ratio around age 30.6&mdash;which we obtain
by exponentiating the difference in constants&ndash;is 2.13, so not wanting
more children at this age is associated with a doubling of the
odds of using contraception. The difference in slopes of
0.048 indicates that this differential increases five percent per
year of age.</p>

<p>The parameter estimates in Table <a href='#t_3_12'>3.12</a> may be used
to produce fitted logits for each age group and category of
desire for more children. In turn, these can be compared with
the empirical logits for the original eight groups, to obtain a
visual impression of the nature of the relationships studied
and the quality of the fit.  The comparison appears in Figure
<a href='#f_3_3'>3.3</a>, with the solid line representing the linear
age effects (the dotted lines are discussed below).
The graph shows clearly how the effect of wanting no more children
increases with age (or, alternatively, how age has much stronger
effects among limiters than among spacers).</p>

<p>The graph also shows that the assumption of linearity of age
effects, while providing a reasonably parsimonious description
of the data, is somewhat suspect, particularly at higher ages.
We can improve the fit by adding higher-order terms on age.
In particular</p>

<ul><li><p>
Introducing a quadratic term on age yields an excellent fit,
with a deviance of 2.34 on three d.f. This model consists of
two parabolas, one for each category of desire for more children,
but with the same curvature.
</p></li><li><p>
Adding a quadratic age by desire interaction further
reduces the deviance to 1.74 on two d.f.
This model allows for two separate parabolas tracing contraceptive
use by age, one for each category of desire.
</p></li></ul>
<p>Although the linear model passes the goodness of fit test, the
fact that we can reduce the deviance by 6.79 at the expense of
one d.f.&nbsp;indicates significant curvature.
The dotted line in Figure <a href='#f_3_3'>3.3</a> shows the intermediate model,
where the curvature by age is the same for the two groups.
While the fit is much better, the overall substantive
conclusions do not change.</p>

<h3>6.5 Models for Ordinal Response Data</h3>
<p>Most of the models discussed so far are appropriate for the
analysis of nominal responses.  They may be applied to
<i>ordinal</i> data as well, but the models make no explicit
use of the fact that the response categories are ordered.
We now consider models designed specifically for the analysis
of responses measured on an ordinal scale. Our discussion
follows closely McCullagh (1980).</p>

<h4>6.5.1 Housing Conditions in Copenhagen</h4>
<p>We will illustrate the application of models for ordinal
data using the data in Table <a href='#t_6_4'>6.4</a>, which was
first published by Madsen (1976) and was reproduced in
Agresti (1990, p.&nbsp;341).
The table classifies 1681 residents of twelve areas in
Copenhagen in terms of the type of housing they had,
their feeling of influence on apartment management,
their degree of contact with other residents,
and their satisfaction with housing conditions.</p>

<p>In our analysis of these data we will treat housing satisfaction
as an ordered response, with categories low, medium and high,
and the other three factors as explanatory variables.</p>

<a name='s_6_5_2'></a><h4>6.5.2 Cumulative Link Models</h4>
<p>All of the models to be considered in this section arise
from focusing on the <i>cumulative</i> distribution of the
response. Let \( \pi_{ij} = \Pr\{Y_i=j\} \) denote the
probability that the response of an individual with
characteristics \( \boldsymbol{x}_i \) falls in the \( j \)-th category, and
let \( \gamma_{ij} \) denote the corresponding cumulative
probability</p>

\[\tag{6.18}\gamma_{ij} = \Pr\{ Y_i \le j\}\]
<p>that the response falls in the \( j \)-th category <i>or below</i>,
so</p>

\[\tag{6.19}\gamma_{ij} = \pi_{i1} + \pi_{i2} + \ldots + \pi_{ij}.\]
<p>Let \( g(.) \) denote a link function mapping probabilities to
the real line. Then the class of models that we will consider
assumes that the transformed <i>cumulative</i> probabilities
are a linear function of the predictors, of the form</p>

<a name='e_6_20'></a>\[\tag{6.20}g(\gamma_{ij}) = \theta_j + \boldsymbol{x}_i'\boldsymbol{\beta}.\]
<p>In this formulation \( \theta_j \) is a constant representing
the baseline value of the transformed cumulative probability
for category \( j \),
and \( \boldsymbol{\beta} \) represents the effect of the covariates on the
transformed cumulative probabilities. Since we write the
constant explicitly, we assume that the predictors do not
include a column of ones.
Note that there is just one equation:
if \( x_{ik} \) increases by one, then <i>all</i>
transformed cumulative probabilities increase by \( \beta_k \).
Thus, this model is more parsimonious than a multinomial
logit or a hierarchical logit model; by focusing on the
cumulative probabilities we can postulate a single effect.
We will return to the issue of interpretation when we consider
specific link functions.</p>

<p>These models can also be interpreted in terms of a <i>latent
variable</i>. Specifically, suppose that the manifest response
\( Y_i \) results from grouping an underlying continuous variable
\( Y_i^* \) using cut-points \( \theta_1 < \theta_2 < \ldots < \theta_{J-1} \),
so that \( Y_i \) takes the value 1 if \( Y_i^* \) is below \( \theta_1 \),
the value 2 if \( Y_i^* \) is between \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), and
so on, taking the value \( J \) if \( Y_i^* \) is above \( \theta_{J-1} \).
Figure <a href='#f_6_4'>6.4</a> illustrates this idea for the
case of five response categories.</p>

<a name='fig:cumlink'></a><a name='f_6_4'></a><p style='text-align:center'>Figure 6.4 An Ordered Response and its  Latent Variable</p><img src="cumlink.png" class="img-responsive center-block"/>
<p>Suppose further that the underlying continuous variable follows
a linear model of the form</p>

\[\tag{6.21}Y_i^* = \boldsymbol{x}_i'\boldsymbol{\beta}^* + \epsilon_i,\]
<p>where the error term \( \epsilon_i \) has c.d.f.&nbsp;\( F(\epsilon_i) \).
Then, the probability that the response of the \( i \)-th individual
will fall in the \( j \)-th category <i>or below</i>, given \( \boldsymbol{x}_i \),
satisfies the equation</p>

\[\tag{6.22}\gamma_{ij} = \Pr\{ Y_i^* < \theta_j\}
 = \Pr\{ \epsilon_i < \theta_j - \boldsymbol{x}_i'\boldsymbol{\beta}^*\}
 = F(\theta_j - \boldsymbol{x}_i'\boldsymbol{\beta}^*)\]
<p>and therefore follows the general form in Equation (<a href='#e_6_20'>6.20</a>)
with link given by the inverse of the c.d.f.&nbsp;of the error term</p>

\[\tag{6.23}g(\gamma_{ij}) = F^{-1}(\gamma_{ij}) = \theta_j - \boldsymbol{x}_i'\boldsymbol{\beta}^*\]
<p>and coefficients \( \boldsymbol{\beta}^*=-\boldsymbol{\beta} \) differing only in sign from
the coefficients in the cumulative link model.
Note that in both formulations we assume that the predictors \( \boldsymbol{x}_i \)
do not include a column of ones because the constant is absorbed in
the cutpoints.</p>

<p>With grouped data the underlying continuous variable \( Y^* \) will have
real existence and the cutpoints \( \theta_j \) will usually be known.
For example income data are often collected in broad categories,
and all we known is the interval where an observation falls,
i.e. \( < \) $25,000,  between $25,000 and $50,000, and so on.</p>

<p>With ordinal categorical data the underlying continuous variable
will often represent a latent or unobservable trait, and the cutpoints
will not be known. This would be the case, for example, if
respondents are asked whether they support a balance budget amendment,
and the response categories are strongly against, against, neutral,
in favor, and strongly in favor. We could imagine an underlying
degree of support \( Y_i^* \) and thresholds \( \theta_1 \) to \( \theta_4 \),
such that when the support is below \( \theta_1 \) one is strongly
against, when the support exceeds \( \theta_1 \) but not \( \theta_2 \)
one is against, and so on, until the case where the support
exceeds \( \theta_4 \) and one is strongly for the amendment.</p>

<p>While the latent variable interpretation is convenient, it is
not always necessary, since some of the models can be interpreted
directly in terms of the transformation \( g(.) \) of the cumulative
probabilities.</p>

<h4>6.5.3 The Proportional Odds Model</h4>
<p>The first model we will consider is a direct extension of the
usual logistic regression model. Instead of applying the
logit transformation to the response probabilities \( \pi_{ij} \),
however,
we apply it to the <i>cumulative</i> response probabilities \( \gamma_{ij} \),
so that</p>

<a name='e_6_24'></a>\[\tag{6.24}\mbox{logit}(\gamma_{ij}) = \log\frac{\gamma_{ij}}{1-\gamma_{ij}}
= \theta_j + \boldsymbol{x}_i'\boldsymbol{\beta}.\]
<p>Some authors refer to this model as the ordered logit model,
because it is a generalization of the logit model to ordered
response categories.
McCullagh (1980) calls it the <i>proportional odds</i> model,
for reasons that will be apparent presently.
Exponentiating (<a href='#e_6_24'>6.24</a>) we find
that the odds of \( Y_{ij} \le j \), in words,
the odds of a response in category \( j \) or below, are</p>

\[\tag{6.25}\frac{\gamma_{ij}}{1-\gamma_{ij}}
= \lambda_j \exp\{\boldsymbol{x}_i'\boldsymbol{\beta}\}\]
<p>where \( \lambda_j=\exp\{\theta_j\} \). The \( \lambda_j \) may be
interpreted as the <i>baseline</i> odds of a response in
category \( j \) or below when \( x=0 \). The effect of the covariates
\( x \) is to raise or lower the odds of a response in
category \( j \) or below by the factor \( \exp\{\boldsymbol{x}_i'\boldsymbol{\beta}\} \).
Note that the effect is a proportionate change in the odds of \( Y_i \le j \)
for all response categories \( j \). If a certain combination of
covariate values doubles the odds of being in category 1,
it also doubles the odds of being in category 2 or below,
or in category 3 or below. Hence the name proportional odds.</p>

<p>This model may also be obtained from the latent variable formulation
assuming that the error term \( \epsilon_i \) has a standard logistic
distribution. In this case
the cdf is</p>

\[\tag{6.26}F(\eta)= \frac{\exp\{ \eta\}}{1 + \exp\{ \eta \}}\]
<p>and the inverse cdf is the logit transformation.
The \( \boldsymbol{\beta}^* \) coefficients may then be interpreted as linear
effects on the underlying continuous variable \( Y_i^* \).</p>

<p>The proportional odds model is not a log-linear model,
and therefore it can not be fit using the standard Poisson trick.
It is possible, however, to use an iteratively re-weighted
least squares algorithm very similar to the standard
algorithm for generalized linear models, for details
see McCullagh (1980).</p>

<p>We will illustrate this model applying it to the
housing satisfaction data in Table <a href='#t_6_4'>6.4</a>.
Let us start by noting that the log-likelihood for
a saturated multinomial model that treats each of the 24
covariate patterns as a different group
is -1715.71.
Fitting a proportional odds model with additive effects
of housing type, influence in management and contact with
neighbors, yields a log-likelihood of -1739.57, which
corresponds to a deviance (compared to the saturated
multinomial model) of 47.73 on 40 d.f. To calculate the
degrees of freedom note that the saturated multinomial
model has 48 parameters (2 for each of 24 groups), while
the additive proportional odds model has only 8 (2 threshold
parameters, 3 for housing type, 2 for influence and one for
contact). The 95% critical point of the \( \chi^2_{40} \) distribution
is 55.8, so you might think that this model fits the data.</p>

<p>To be thorough, however, we should investigate interaction
effects. The models with one two-factor interaction have
log-likelihoods of -1739.47 (including contact \( \times \) influence),
-1735.24 (including housing \( \times \) contact), and -1728.32
(including housing \( \times \) influence), with corresponding
deviance reductions of 0.21, 8.67 and 22.51, at the
expense of 2, 3 and 6 degrees of freedom, respectively.
Clearly the only interaction of note is that of
housing \( \times \) influence, which has a P-value of 0.001.
Adding this term gives a model deviance of 25.22 on 34 d.f.&nbsp;and
an excellent fit to the data.</p>

<p>Table <a href='#t_6_5'>6.5</a> shows parameter estimates for the
final model with all three predictors and a housing \( \times \)
influence interaction. The table lists the
cutpoints and the regression coefficients.</p>

<p>Note first the cutpoints: -.89 and .31, corresponding to cumulative odds of
0.41 and  1.37, or to cumulative probabilities of 0.29 and 0.58, for the
reference cell. Considering residents of tower blocks with low influence
in management and low contact with neighbors, we estimate that 29% have
low satisfaction, 29% (58-29) have medium satisfaction, and
42% (100-58) have high satisfaction. (These values are fairly close
to the observed proportions.)</p>

<p>Before we discuss interpretation of the remaining coefficients, we
must note that I have reported the coefficients corresponding to
the latent variable formulation (the \( \boldsymbol{\beta}^* \)&rsquo;s) rather than the
cumulative link coefficients (the \( \boldsymbol{\beta} \)&rsquo;s), which have opposite sign.
Thus, a positive coefficient is equivalent to a shift to the right
on the latent scale, which increases the odds of being to the <i>right</i>
of a cutpoint.
Equation (<a href='#e_6_24'>6.24</a>) models the odds of being
to the <i>left</i> of a cutpoint, which would then decrease.
I prefer the sign used here
because the interpretation is more straightforward. A positive
coefficient increases one&rsquo;s underlying satisfaction, which makes
a &lsquo;high&rsquo; response more likely.</p>

<p>The coefficient of contact indicates that residents who have high contact with
their neighbors are generally more satisfied than those who have low contact.
The odds of high satisfaction (as opposed to medium or low),
are 45% higher for high contact than for low contact,
as are the odds of medium or high satisfaction (as opposed to low).
The fact that the effect of contact on the odds is the same
45% for the two comparisons is a feature of the model.</p>

<p>To interpret the effects of the next two variables, type of housing
and degree of influence, we have to allow for their interaction effect.
One way to do this is to consider the effect of type of housing
when the residents feel that they have low influence on management;
then residents of apartments and houses (particularly terraced houses)
are <i>less</i> satisfied than residents of tower blocks.
Feeling that one has some influence on management generally increases
satisfaction; the effect of having high rather than low influence
is to increase the odds of medium or high satisfaction (as opposed to low)
by 138% for residents of tower blocks, 390% for apartment dwellers,
104% for residents of atrium houses and 455% for those who live
in terraced houses.
Having medium influence is generally better than having low influence
(except for tower clock residents), but not quite as good as having
high influence (except possibly for residents of atrium houses).</p>

<p>Although we have interpreted the results in terms of odds,
we can also interpret the coefficients in terms of a latent
variable representing degree of satisfaction.
The effect of having high contact with the neighbors,
as compared to low contact, is to
shift one&rsquo;s position on the latent satisfaction scale by
0.37 points. Similarly, having high influence on
management, as compared to low influence, shifts one&rsquo;s position
by an amount that varies from 0.71 for residents of atrium
houses to 1.71 for residents of terraced houses.
Interpretation of these numbers must be done by
reference to the standard logistic distribution,
which is depicted in Figure <a href='#f_6_4'>6.4</a>.
This symmetric distribution has mean 0 and
standard deviation \( \pi/\sqrt 3=1.81 \). The
quartiles are \( \pm 1.1 \), and just over 90% of
the area lies between -3 and 3.</p>

<h4>6.5.4 The Ordered Probit Model</h4>
<p>The ordered probit model, first considered by Aitchison and
Silvey (1957), results from modeling the <i>probit</i> of the
cumulative probabilities as a linear function of the covariates,
so that</p>

\[\tag{6.27}\Phi^{-1}(\gamma_{ij}) = \theta_j + \boldsymbol{x}_i'\boldsymbol{\beta}\]
<p>where \( \Phi() \) is the standard normal cdf. The model can
also be obtained from the latent-variable formulation assuming
that the error term has a standard normal distribution,
and this is usually the way one would interpret the parameters.</p>

<p>Estimates from the ordered probit model are usually very similar
to estimates from the ordered logit model&mdash;as one would expect from
the similarity of the normal and the logistic distributions&mdash;provided
one remembers to standardize the coefficients to correct for the
fact that the standard normal distribution has variance one,
whereas the standard logistic has variance \( \pi^2/3 \).</p>

<p>For the Copenhagen data, the ordered probit model with
an interaction between housing type and influence has a
log-likelihood of -1728.67, corresponding to a deviance
of 25.9 on 34 d.f., almost indistinguishable from the
deviance for the ordered logit model with the same terms.
Table <a href='#t_6_6'>6.6</a> shows parameter estimates for this model.</p>

</table>

<p>The cutpoints can be interpreted in terms of z-scores: the boundary
between low and medium satisfaction is at \( z=-0.54 \) and the boundary
between medium and high satisfaction is at \( z=0.19 \). These values
leave \( \Phi(-.54)=0.29 \) or 29% of the reference group in the
low satisfaction category, \( \Phi(0.19)-\Phi(-0.54)=0.28 \) or 28%
in the medium satisfaction category, and \( 1-\Phi(0.19)=0.42 \) or 42%
in the high satisfaction category.</p>

<p>The remaining coefficients can be interpreted as in a linear regression
model. For example, having high contact with the neighbors, compared
to low contact, increases one&rsquo;s position in the latent satisfaction scale
by 0.23 standard deviations (or increases one&rsquo;s \( z \)-score by 0.23),
everything else being equal.</p>

<p>Note that this coefficient is very similar to the equivalent
value obtained in the ordered logit model.
A shift of 0.37 in a standard logistic
distribution, where \( \sigma=\pi/\sqrt 3= 1.81 \), is equivalent
to a shift of \( 0.37/1.81=0.21 \) standard deviations,
which in turn is very similar to
the ordered probit estimate of 0.23 standard deviations.
A similar comment applies to the other coefficients.
You may also wish to compare the Wald tests for the
individual coefficients in Tables <a href='#t_6_5'>6.5</a> and <a href='#t_6_6'>6.6</a>,
which are practically identical.</p>

<h4>6.5.5 Proportional Hazards</h4>
<p>A third possible choice of link is the complementary log-log link,
which leads to the model</p>

<a name='e_6_28'></a>\[\tag{6.28}\log(-\log( 1- \gamma_{ij}) ) = \theta_j + \boldsymbol{x}_i'\boldsymbol{\beta}\]
<p>This model may be interpreted in terms of a latent variable
having a (reversed) extreme value (log Weibull) distribution,
with cdf</p>

\[\tag{6.29}F(\eta) = 1 - \exp\{ -\exp \{\eta\} \}\]
<p>This distribution is asymmetric, it has mean equal to
negative Euler&rsquo;s constant \( -0.57722 \) and variance \( \pi^2/6=1.6449 \).
The median is \( \log\log 2= -0.3665 \)
and the quartiles are -1.2459 and 0.3266. Note that the
inverse cdf is indeed, the complementary log-log transformation
in Equation (<a href='#e_6_28'>6.28</a>).</p>

<p>This model can also be interpreted in terms of a proportional
hazards model. The hazard function plays a central role in
survival analysis, and will be discussed in detail in the next
Chapter.</p>

<h4>6.5.6 Extensions and Other Approaches</h4>
<p>The general cumulative link model of Section <a href='#s_6_5_2'>6.5.2</a> will
work with any monotone link function mapping probabilities to the
real line, but the three choices mentioned here, namely the logit,
probit, and complementary log-log, are by far the most popular
ones. McCullagh (1980) has extended the basic model by relaxing
the assumption of constant variance for the latent continuous
variable. His most general model allows a separate scale parameter
for each multinomial observation, so that</p>

\[\tag{6.30}g(\gamma_{ij}) = \frac{\theta_j+\boldsymbol{x}_i'\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\tau_i}\]
<p>where the \( \tau_i \) are unknown scale parameters. A constraint, such
as \( \tau_1=0 \), is required for identification. More generally,
\( \tau_i \) may be allowed to depend on a vector of covariates.</p>

<p>An alternative approach to the analysis of ordinal data is
to assign scores to the response categories and then use
linear regression to model the mean score.
Ordinary least squares procedures are not appropriate in this
case, but Grizzle et al.&nbsp;(1969) have proposed weighted least-squares
procedures that make proper allowances for the underlying
independent multinomial sampling scheme.
For an excellent discussion of these models see Agresti (1990, Section 9.6).</p>

<p>A similar approach, used often in two-way contingency tables corresponding
to one predictor and one response, is to assign scores to the rows
and columns of the table and to use these scores to model the
interaction term in the usual log-linear model. Often the scores
assigned to the columns are the integers \( 1,2, \ldots, J-1 \),
but other choices are possible.
If integer scores are used for both rows and columns,
then the resulting model has an interesting property,
which has been referred to as <i>uniform association</i>.
Consider calculating an odds ratio
for adjacent rows \( i \) and \( i+1 \), across <i>adjacent</i> columns
or  response categories \( j \) and \( j+1 \), that is</p>

\[\tag{6.31}\rho_{ij}=\frac{ \pi_{i,j} / \pi_{i,j+1}} { \pi_{i+1,j} / \pi_{i+1,j+1} }\]
<p>Under the additive log-linear model of independence, this ratio
is unity for all \( i \) and \( j \). Introducing an interaction term based on
integer scores, of the form \( (\alpha\beta)_{ij}= \gamma i j \),
makes the odds ratio constant across adjacent categories.
This model often produces fits similar to the proportional odds
model, but the parameters are not so easily interpreted. For further
details see Haberman (1974), Goodman (1979) or Agresti (1990, Section 8.1).</p>

<p>A fourth family of models for ordinal responses follows from
introducing constraints in the multinomial logit model.
Let \( \boldsymbol{\beta}_j \) denote the vector of coefficients for the \( j \)-th
equation, comparing the \( j \)-th category with the last category,
for \( j=1, 2, \ldots, J-1 \).
The most restrictive model assumes that these coefficients are
the same for all contrasts, so \( \boldsymbol{\beta}_j=\boldsymbol{\beta} \) for all \( j \).
A less restrictive assumption is that the coefficients have a
linear trend over the categories, so that \( \boldsymbol{\beta}_j = j \boldsymbol{\beta} \).
Anderson (1984) has proposed a model termed the <i>stereotype</i>
model where the coefficients are proportional across categories,
so \( \boldsymbol{\beta}_j = \gamma_j \boldsymbol{\beta} \), with unknown  proportionality factors
given by scalars \( \gamma_j \).</p>

<p>One advantage of the cumulative link models considered here is
that the parameter estimates refer to the cumulative distribution
of the manifest response (or the distribution of the underlying
latent variable) and therefore are not heavily dependent on the
actual categories (or cutpoints) used.  In particular, we would
not expect the results to change much if we were to combine
two adjacent categories, or if we recoded the response using fewer
categories.
If the cumulative odds are indeed proportional before collapsing
categories, the argument goes, they should continue to be so afterwards.</p>

<p>In contrast, inferences based on log-linear or multinomial
logit models apply only to the actual categories used.
It is quite possible, for example, that odds ratios that are
relatively constant across adjacent categories will no longer
exhibit this property if some of the categories are combined.
These considerations are particularly relevant if the
categories used are somewhat arbitrary.</p>

<h3>2.7 Two-Way Analysis of Variance</h3>
<p>We now consider models involving two factors with
discrete levels. We illustrate using the sample data
with both social setting and family planning effort grouped
into categories. Key issues involve the concepts of main
effects and interactions.</p>

<h4>2.7.1 The Two-Way Layout</h4>
<p>Table <a href='#t_2_13'>2.13</a> shows the CBR decline in our
20 countries classified according to two criteria:
social setting, with categories low (under 70),
medium (70&ndash;79) and high (80+), and
family planning effort, with categories weak (0&ndash;4),
moderate (5&ndash;14) and strong (15+).
In our example both setting and effort are
factors with three levels.
Note that there are no countries with strong programs
in low social settings.</p>

<a name='t_2_13'></a><p class='text-center'>Table 2.13. CBR Decline by Levels of Social Setting<br/>and Levels of Family Planning Effort</p>
<table class='tex-table'>
<tr class='bt'><td class='al' rowspan='2'>Setting</td><td colspan='3' align='center'>Effort</td></tr>
<tr class='bb'><td class='al'>Weak</td><td class='al'>Moderate</td><td class='al'>Strong</td></tr>
<tr class='bt'><td class='al'>Low</td><td class='al'>1,0,7</td><td class='al'>21,13,4,7</td><td class='al'>&ndash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class='al'>Medium</td><td class='al'>10,6,2</td><td class='al'>0</td><td class='al'>25</td></tr>
<tr class='bb'><td class='al'>High</td><td class='al'>9</td><td class='al'>11</td><td class='al'>29,29,40,21,22,29</td></tr>
</table>

<p>We will modify our notation to reflect the two-way
layout of the data.
Let \( n_{ij} \) denote the number of observations in the
\( (i,j) \)-th cell of the table, i.e. in row \( i \) and
column \( j \), and let
\( y_{ijk} \) denote the response of the \( k \)-th unit in
that cell, for \( k=1, \ldots, n_{ij} \).
  In our example \( y_{ijk} \) is the CBR decline
of the \( k \)-th country in the \( i \)-th category of setting
and the \( j \)-th category of effort.</p>

<h4>2.7.2 The Two-Factor Additive Model</h4>
<a name='e_2_19'></a>\[\tag{2.19}\mu_{ijk} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j\]
<p>In this formulation \( \mu \) represents a baseline value,
\( \alpha_i \) represents the effect of the \( i \)-th level of the
row factor and
\( \beta_j \) represents the effect of the \( j \)-th level of the
column factor.
Before we proceed further we must note that the model
is not identified as stated. You could add a constant
\( \delta \) to each of the \( \alpha_i \)&rsquo;s (or to each of the
\( \beta_j \)&rsquo;s) and subtract it from
\( \mu \) without altering any of the expected responses.
Clearly we need two constraints to identify the model.</p>

<p>Our preferred approach relies on the reference cell method, and
sets to zero the effects for the first cell (in the top-left
corner of the table), so that \( \alpha_1 = \beta_1 = 0 \). The best
way to understand the meaning of the remaining parameters is to
study Table <a href='#t_2_14'>2.14</a>, showing the expected response for
each combination of levels of row and column factors having three
levels each.</p>

<a name='t_2_14'></a><p class='text-center'>Table 2.14. The Two-Factor Additive Model</p>
<table class='tex-table'>
<tr class='bt'><td class='al' rowspan='2'>Row</td><td colspan='3' align='center'>Column</td></tr>
<tr class='bb'><td class='al'>1</td><td class='al'>2</td><td class='al'>3</td></tr>
<tr class='bt'><td class='al'>1</td><td class='al'>\(\mu\)</td><td class='al'>\(\mu+\beta_2\)</td><td class='al'>\(\mu+\beta_3\)</td></tr>
<tr><td class='al'>2</td><td class='al'>\(\mu+\alpha_2\)</td><td class='al'>\(\mu+\alpha_2+\beta_2\)</td><td class='al'>\(\mu+\alpha_2+\beta_3\)</td></tr>
<tr class='bb'><td class='al'>3</td><td class='al'>\(\mu+\alpha_3\)</td><td class='al'>\(\mu+\alpha_3+\beta_2\)</td><td class='al'>\(\mu+\alpha_3+\beta_3\)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In this formulation of the model
\( \mu \) represents the expected response in the reference cell,
\( \alpha_i \) represents the effect
of level \( i \) of the row factor (compared to level 1)
for any fixed level of the column factor, and
\( \beta_j \) represents the effect of level \( j \) of the column
factor (compared to level 1) for any fixed level
of the row factor.</p>

<p>Note that the model is <i>additive</i>, in the sense
that the effect of each factor is the same at all
levels of the other factor. To see this point consider
moving from the first to the second row. The response
increases by \( \alpha_2 \) if we move down the first
column, but also if we move down the second or
third columns.</p>

<h4>2.7.3 Estimates and Standard Errors</h4>
<p>The model in Equation <a href='#e_2_19'>2.19</a> is a special
case of the general linear model, where the model matrix
\( \boldsymbol{X} \) has a column of ones representing the constant, and
two sets  of dummy or indicator variables representing
the levels of the row  and column factors, respectively.
This matrix is not of full column rank because the
row (as well as the column) dummies add to the constant.
Clearly we need two constraints and we choose to drop
the dummy variables corresponding to the first row
and to the first column. Table <a href='#t_2_15'>2.15</a> shows
the resulting parameter estimates, standard errors
and \( t \)-ratios for our example.</p>

<a name='t_2_15'></a><p class='text-center'>Table 2.15. Parameter Estimates for Two-Factor Additive Model<br/>of CBR Decline by Social Setting and
Family Planning Effort</p>
<table class='tex-table'>
<tr class='bt bb'><td colspan='2' align='left'>Parameter</td><td class='ar'>Symbol</td><td class='ar'>Estimate</td><td class='ar'>Std. Error</td><td class='ar'>\(t\)-ratio</td></tr>
<tr class='bt'><td class='al'>Baseline</td><td class='al'>low/weak</td><td class='ar'>\(\mu\)</td><td class='ar'>5.379</td><td class='ar'>3.105</td><td class='ar'>1.73</td></tr>
<tr><td class='al'>Setting</td><td class='al'>medium</td><td class='ar'>\(\alpha_2\)</td><td class='ar'>\(-\)1.681</td><td class='ar'>3.855</td><td class='ar'>\(-0.44\)</td></tr>
<tr><td class='al'></td><td class='al'>high</td><td class='ar'>\(\alpha_3\)</td><td class='ar'>2.388</td><td class='ar'>4.457</td><td class='ar'>0.54</td></tr>
<tr><td class='al'>Effort</td><td class='al'>moderate</td><td class='ar'>\(\beta_2\)</td><td class='ar'>3.836</td><td class='ar'>3.575</td><td class='ar'>1.07</td></tr>
<tr class='bb'><td class='al'></td><td class='al'>strong</td><td class='ar'>\(\beta_3\)</td><td class='ar'>20.672</td><td class='ar'>4.339</td><td class='ar'>4.76</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Thus, we expect a CBR decline of 5.4% in
countries with low setting and weak programs.
In countries with medium or high social setting we expect CBR
declines of 1.7 percentage points <i>less</i> and 2.4 percentage
points more, respectively, than in countries with low setting and
the same level of effort.
Finally, in countries  with moderate or strong programs we
expect CBR declines of 3.8 and 20.7 percentage points more than
in countries with weak programs and the same level of social setting.</p>

<p>It appears from a cursory examination of the \( t \)-ratios in Table
<a href='#t_2_15'>2.15</a> that the only significant effect is the difference
between strong and weak programs. Bear in mind, however, that the table
only shows the comparisons that are explicit in the chosen
parameterization. In this example it turns out that the difference
between strong and moderate programs is also significant. (This test
can be calculated from the variance-covariance matrix of the estimates,
or by fitting the model with strong programs as the reference cell, so
the medium-strong comparison becomes one of the parameters.) Questions
of significance for factors with more than two-levels are best
addressed by using the \( F \)-test discussed below.</p>

<h4>2.7.4 The Hierarchical Anova Table</h4>
<p>Fitting the two-factor additive model results in a residual
sum of squares of 574.4 on 15 d.f., and represents an
improvement over the null model of 2075.8 at the expense of
four d.f.  We can further decompose this gain as an
improvement of 1193.8 on 2 d.f.&nbsp;due to social setting
(from Section 2.6) and a gain of 882.0, also on 2 d.f.,
due to effort given setting. These calculations are set
out in Table <a href='#t_2_16'>2.16</a>, which also shows the
corresponding mean squares and \( F \)-ratios.</p>

<a name='t_2_16'></a><p class='text-center'>Table 2.16. Hierarchical Anova for Two-Factor Additive Model<br/>of CBR Decline by Social Setting and Family Planning Effort</p>
<table class='tex-table'>
<tr class='bt'><td class='al'>Source of</td><td class='ar'>Sum of</td><td class='ar'>Degrees of</td><td class='ar'>Mean</td><td class='ar'>\(F\)-</td></tr>
<tr class='bb'><td class='al'>variation</td><td class='ar'>squares</td><td class='ar'>freedom</td><td class='ar'>squared</td><td class='ar'>ratio</td></tr>
<tr class='bt'><td class='al'>Setting</td><td class='ar'>1193.8</td><td class='ar'>2</td><td class='ar'>596.9</td><td class='ar'>15.6</td></tr>
<tr><td class='al'>Effort\(|\)Setting</td><td class='ar'>882.0</td><td class='ar'>2</td><td class='ar'>441.0</td><td class='ar'>11.5</td></tr>
<tr><td class='al'>Residual</td><td class='ar'>574.4</td><td class='ar'>15</td><td class='ar'>38.3</td><td></td></tr>
<tr class='bb'><td class='al'>Total</td><td class='ar'>2650.2</td><td class='ar'>19</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<p>We can combine the sum of squares for setting and for effort
given setting to construct a test for the overall significance
of the regression. This results in an \( F \)-ratio of 13.6 on
four and 15 d.f., and is highly significant.
The second of the \( F \)-ratios shown in
Table <a href='#t_2_16'>2.16</a>, which is 11.5 on two and 15 d.f.,
is a test for the <i>net</i>
effect of family planning effort after accounting for
social setting, and is highly significant.
(The first of the \( F \)-ratios in the table, 15.6 on
two and 15 d.f., is not in common use but is shown
for completeness; it can be interpreted as an
alternative test for the <i>gross</i> effect of setting,
which combines the same numerator as the test in the previous
section with a more refined denominator that takes into account
the effect of effort.)</p>

<p>There is an alternative decomposition of the regression
sum of squares into an improvement of 2040.0 on two d.f.&nbsp;due to effort
and a further gain of 35.8 on two d.f.&nbsp;due to setting given effort.
The latter can be contrasted with the error sum of squares
of 574.4 on 15 d.f.&nbsp;to obtain a test of the <i>net</i> effect
of setting given effort. This test would address the question
of whether socio-economic conditions have an effect on
fertility decline after we have accounted for family
planning effort.</p>

<h4>2.7.5 Partial and Multiple Correlation Ratios</h4>
<p>The sums of squares described above can be turned into
proportions of variance explained using the now-familiar
calculations. For example the two factors
together explain 2075.8 out of 2650.2, or 78.3% of
the variation in CBR decline.</p>

<p>The square root of this proportion, 0.885 in the example,
is the <i>multiple correlation ratio</i>;
it is analogous to (and in fact is often called)
the multiple correlation coefficient. We use the word
&lsquo;ratio&rsquo; to emphasize the categorical nature of the
predictors and to note that it generalizes to more than
one factor the correlation ratio introduced in Section 2.4.</p>

<p>We can also calculate the proportion of variance
explained by one of the factors out of the amount
left unexplained by the other. In our example effort
explained 882.0 out of the 1456.6 that setting had left
unexplained, or 60.6%.  The square root of this proportion,
0.778, is called the <i>partial correlation ratio</i>,
and can be interpreted as a measure of correlation
between a discrete factor and a continuous variable
after adjustment for another factor.</p>

<h4>2.7.6 Fitted Means and Standardization</h4>
<p>Parameter estimates from the additive model can be
translated into <i>fitted means</i> using Equation <a href='#e_2_19'>2.19</a>
evaluated at the estimates.
The body of Table <a href='#t_2_17'>2.17</a> shows these values for
our illustrative example. Note that we are able to estimate the
expected CBR decline for strong programs in low social settings although
there is no country in our dataset with that particular combination of
attributes.  Such extrapolation relies on the additive nature of
the model and should be interpreted with caution.
Comparison of observed and fitted values can yield useful
insights into the adequacy of the model, a topic that will
be pursued in more detail when we discuss regression diagnostics
later in this chapter.</p>

<a name='t_2_17'></a><p class='text-center'>Table 2.17. Fitted Means Based on Two-Factor Additive Model<br/>of CBR Decline by Social Setting and Family Planning Effort</p>
<table class='tex-table'>
<tr class='bt'><td class='al' rowspan='2'>Setting</td><td colspan='3' align='center'>Effort</td><td class='ar'>All</td></tr>
<tr class='bb'><td class='ar'>Weak</td><td class='ar'>Moderate</td><td class='ar'>Strong</td><td></td></tr>
<tr class='bt'><td class='al'>Low</td><td class='ar'>5.38</td><td class='ar'>9.22</td><td class='ar'>26.05</td><td class='ar'>13.77</td></tr>

<tr class='bb'><td class='al'>High</td><td class='ar'>7.77</td><td class='ar'>11.60</td><td class='ar'>28.44</td><td class='ar'>16.15</td></tr>
<tr class='bt bb'><td class='al'>All</td><td class='ar'>5.91</td><td class='ar'>9.75</td><td class='ar'>26.59</td><td class='ar'>14.30</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Table <a href='#t_2_17'>2.17</a> also shows column (and row) means,
representing expected CBR declines by effort (and setting)
after adjusting for the other factor.
The column means are calculated as weighted averages of
the cell means in each column, with weights given by the
total number of countries in each category of setting.
In symbols</p>

\[ \hat{\mu}_{.j} = \sum n_{i.} \hat{\mu}_{ij}/ n, \]
<p>where we have used a dot as a subscript placeholder
so \( n_{i.} \) is the number of observations in row \( i \) and
\( \mu_{.j} \)  is the mean for column \( j \).</p>

<p>The resulting estimates may be interpreted as
<i>standardized</i> means; they estimate the CBR
decline that would be expected at each level of effort
if those countries had the same distribution of
social setting as the total sample.
(The column means can also be calculated by using the fitted
model to predict CBR decline for each observation with
the dummies representing social setting held fixed at their
sample averages and all other terms kept as observed.
This construction helps reinforce their interpretation
in terms of predicted CBR decline at various levels of
effort adjusted for setting.)</p>

<a name='t_2_18'></a><p class='text-center'>Table 2.18. CBR Decline by Family Planning Effort<br/>Before and After Adjustment for Social Setting</p>

<tr class='bb'><td class='al'>Strong</td><td class='ar'>27.86</td><td class='ar'>26.59</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Standardized means may be useful in presenting the results of a
regression analysis to a non-technical audience, as done in Table
<a href='#t_2_18'>2.18</a>. The column labelled unadjusted shows the observed mean
CBR decline by level of effort. The difference of 23 points between
strong and weak programs may be due to program effort, but could also
reflect differences in social setting. The column labelled adjusted
corrects for compositional differences in social setting using the
additive model. The difference of 21 points may be interpreted as an
effect of program effort net of social setting.</p>

<h4>2.7.7 Multiple Classification Analysis</h4>
<p>Multiple Classification Analysis (MCA), a technique
that has enjoyed some popularity in Sociology, turns
out to be just another name for the two factor additive model
discussed in this section (and more generally, for multi-factor
additive models).
A nice feature of MCA, however, is a tradition of presenting the
results of the analysis in a table that contains</p>

<ul><li><p>
 the gross effect of each of the factors,
calculated using a one-factor model under the `usual'
restrictions, together with the corresponding
correlation ratios (called `eta' coefficients), and

</p></li><li><p>
the net effect of each factor, calculated
using a two-factor additive model under the
`usual' restrictions, together with
the corresponding partial correlation ratios
(unfortunately called `beta' coefficients).
</p></li></ul>
<p>Table <a href='#t_2_19'>2.19</a> shows a multiple classification
analysis of the program effort data that follows
directly from the results obtained so far.
Estimates for the additive model under the usual restrictions
can be obtained from Table <a href='#t_2_18'>2.18</a>
as differences between the row and column means and
the overall mean.</p>

<a name='t_2_19'></a><p class='text-center'>Table 2.19. Multiple Classification Analysis of CBR Decline<br/>by Social Setting and Family Planning Effort</p>

<tr class='bt bb'><td class='al'>Total</td><td class='al'></td><td class='ar'>14.30</td><td class='ar'></td><td class='ar'>14.30</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The overall expected decline in the CBR is 14.3%.
The effects of low, medium and high setting are substantially
reduced after adjustment for effort, an attenuation
reflected in the reduction of the correlation ratio
from 0.67 to 0.24.  On the other hand, the effects
of weak, moderate and strong programs are slightly reduced
after adjustment for social setting, as can be seen from
correlation ratios of 0.88 and 0.78 before and after
adjustment.
The analysis indicates that the effects of
effort are more pronounced and more resilient to
adjustment than the effects of social setting.</p>

<h4>2.7.8 The Model With Interactions</h4>
<p>The analysis so far has rested on the assumption of additivity.
We now consider a more general model for the effects of
two discrete factors on a continuous response which
allows for more general effects</p>

\[\tag{2.20}\mu_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + (\alpha\beta)_{ij}.\]
<p>In this formulation the first three terms should be familiar:
\( \mu \) is a constant,
and \( \alpha_i \) and \( \beta_j \) are
the <i>main</i> effects of levels \( i \) of the row factor
and \( j \) of the column factor.</p>

<p>The new term \( (\alpha\beta)_{ij} \) is an <i>interaction</i> effect.
It represents the effect of the <i>combination</i> of levels \( i \)
and \( j \) of the row and column factors.
(The notation \( (\alpha\beta) \) should be understood
as a single symbol, not a product;
we could have used \( \gamma_{ij} \) to denote the interaction,
but the notation \( (\alpha\beta)_{ij} \) is more suggestive and reminds
us that the term involves a combined effect.)</p>

<p>One difficulty with the model as defined so far is that it is grossly
overparameterized. If the row and column factors have \( R \) and \( C \)
levels, respectively, we have only \( RC \) possible cells but have
introduced \( 1+R+C+RC \) parameters. Our preferred solution is an
extension of the reference cell method, and sets to zero all parameters
involving the first row or the first column in the two-way layout, so
that \( \alpha_1 = \beta_1 = (\alpha\beta)_{1j} = (\alpha\beta)_{i1} =
0 \). The best way to understand the meaning of the remaining parameters
is to study Table <a href='#t_2_20'>2.20</a>, which shows the structure of the
means in a three by three layout.</p>

<a name='t_2_20'></a><p class='text-center'>Table 2.20. The Two-Factor Model With Interactions</p>
<table class='tex-table'>
<tr class='bt'><td class='al'>Row</td><td colspan='3' align='center'>Column</td></tr>
<tr class='bb'><td class='al'></td><td class='al'>1</td><td class='al'>2</td><td class='al'>3</td></tr>
<tr class='bt'><td class='al'>1</td><td class='al'>\(\mu\)</td><td class='al'>\(\mu+\beta_2\)</td><td class='al'>\(\mu+\beta_3\)</td></tr>
<tr><td class='al'>2</td><td class='al'>\(\mu+\alpha_2\)</td><td class='al'>\(\mu + \alpha_2 + \beta_2 + (\alpha\beta)_{22}\)</td><td class='al'>\(\mu + \alpha_2 + \beta_3 + (\alpha\beta)_{23}\)</td></tr>
<tr class='bb'><td class='al'>3</td><td class='al'>\(\mu + \alpha_3\)</td><td class='al'>\(\mu + \alpha_3 + \beta_2 + (\alpha\beta)_{32}\)</td><td class='al'>\(\mu + \alpha_3 + \beta_3 + (\alpha\beta)_{33}\)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Here \( \mu \) is the expected response in the reference cell,
just as before.
The main effects are now more specialized:
\( \alpha_i \) is the effect of level \( i \) of the row factor,
compared to level one, when the column factor is at level one,
and
\( \beta_j \) is the effect of level \( j \) of the column factor,
compared to level one, when the row factor is at level one.
The interaction term
\( (\alpha\beta)_{ij} \) is the additional effect of
level \( i \) of the row factor, compared to level one,
when the column factor is at level \( j \) rather than one.
This term can also be interpreted as the additional effect of
level \( j \) of the column factor, compared to level one,
when the row factor is at level \( i \) rather than one.</p>

<p>The key feature of this model is that the effect of a
factor now depends on the levels of the other. For
example the effect of level two of the row factor, compared
to level one, is \( \alpha_2 \) in the first column,
\( \alpha_2+(\alpha\beta)_{22} \) in the second column, and
\( \alpha_2+(\alpha\beta)_{23} \) in the third column.</p>

<p>The resulting model is a special case of the general
lineal model where the model matrix \( \boldsymbol{X} \) has a column
of ones to represent the constant, a set of \( R-1 \)
dummy variables representing the row effects, a set
of \( C-1 \) dummy variables representing the column effects,
and a set of \( (R-1)(C-1) \) dummy variables representing
the interactions.</p>

<p>The easiest way to calculate the
interaction dummies is as products of the row and
column dummies. If \( r_i \) takes the value one for
observations in row \( i \) and zero otherwise,
and \( c_j \) takes the value one for observations in
column \( j1 \) and zero otherwise, then the product
\( r_i c_j \) takes the value one for observations that
are in row \( i \) <i>and</i> column \( j \), and is zero for
all others.</p>

<p>In order to fit this model to the program effort data
we need to introduce one additional constraint because the cell
corresponding to strong programs in low settings is empty.
As a result, we cannot distinguish \( \beta_3 \) from
\( \beta_3+(\alpha\beta)_{23} \). A simple solution is to
set \( (\alpha\beta)_{23}=0 \). This constraint is easily
implemented by dropping the corresponding dummy,
which would be \( r_2 c_3 \) in the above notation.</p>

<p>The final model has eight parameters: the constant, two setting
effects, two effort effects, and three (rather than four)
interaction terms.</p>

<p>Fitting the model gives a \( \mbox{RSS} \) of 460.8 on
12 d.f. Combining this result with the anova for the
additive model leads to the hierarchical anova in
Table <a href='#t_2_21'>2.21</a>. The \( F \)-test for the interaction
is one on three and 12 d.f.&nbsp;and is clearly not
significant. Thus, we have no evidence to contradict
the assumption of additivity.  We conclude that the
effect of effort is the same at all social settings.
Calculation and interpretation of the parameter
estimates is left as an exercise.</p>

<h4>2.7.9 Factors or Variates?</h4>
<p>In our analysis of CBR decline we treated
social setting and family planning effort as continuous
<i>variates</i> with linear effects in Sections 2.4 and 2.5,
and as discrete <i>factors</i> in Sections 2.6 and 2.7.</p>

<p>The fundamental difference between the two approaches
hinges on the assumption of linearity. When we treat a
predictor as a continuous variate we assume a linear effect.
If the assumption is reasonable we attain a parsimonious fit,
but if it is not reasonable we are forced to introduce transformations
or higher-order polynomial terms, resulting in models which are
often harder to interpret.</p>

<p>A reasonable alternative in these cases is to model the predictor as a
discrete factor, an approach that allows arbitrary changes in the
response from one category to another.  This approach has the advantage
of a simpler and more direct interpretation, but by grouping the
predictor into categories we are not making full use of the information
in the data.</p>

<p>In our example we found that social setting explained 45%
of the variation in CBR declines when treated as a variate
and 45% when treated as a factor with three levels. Both
approaches give the same result, suggesting that the
assumption of linearity of setting effects is reasonable.</p>

<p>On the other hand family planning effort explained 64%
when treated as a variate and 77% when treated as a
factor with three levels.  The difference suggests that we
might be better off grouping effort into three categories.
The reason, of course, is that the effect of effort is
non-linear: CBR decline changes little as we move from
weak to moderate programs, but raises steeply for strong
programs.</p>

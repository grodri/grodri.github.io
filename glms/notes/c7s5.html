<h3>7.5 Infant and Child Mortality in Colombia</h3>
<p>We will illustrate the use of piece-wise exponential survival
models using data from an analysis of infant and child mortality
in Colombia done by Somoza&nbsp;(1980).  The data were collected in a
1976 survey conducted as part of the World Fertility Survey.
The sample consisted of women between the ages of 15 and 49.
The questionnaire included a maternity history, recording for
each child ever born to each respondent the sex, date of
birth, survival status as of the interview and (if applicable)
age at death.</p>

<h4>7.5.1 Calculating Events and Exposure</h4>
<p>As if often the case with survival data, most of the work goes
into preparing the data for analysis. In the present case we
started from tables in Somoza&rsquo;s article showing living children
classified by current age, and dead children classified by age at
death. Both tabulations reported age using the groups shown in
Table <a href='#t_7_1'>7.1</a>, using fine categories early in life, when
the risk if high but declines rapidly, and wider categories at later ages.
With these two bits of information we were able to
tabulate deaths and calculate exposure time by age groups,
assuming that children who died or were censored in an interval
lived on the average half the length of the interval.</p>

<p>Table <a href='#t_7_1'>7.1</a> shows the results of these calculations
in terms of the number of deaths and the total number of person-years
of exposure to risk between birth and age ten, by categories of
age of child, for three groups of children (or cohorts) born in
1941&ndash;59, 1960&ndash;67 and 1968&ndash;76.
The purpose of our analysis will be to assess the magnitude of
the expected decline in infant and child mortality across these
cohorts, and to study whether mortality has declined uniformly
at all ages or more rapidly in certain age groups.</p>

<h4>7.5.2 Fitting The Poisson Models</h4>
<p>Let \( y_{ij} \) denote the number of deaths for cohort \( i \) (with \( i=1,2,3 \))
in age group \( j \) (for \( j=1,2,\ldots,7 \)).  In view of the results of
the previous section, we treat the \( y_{ij} \) as realizations of
Poisson random variables with means \( \mu_{ij} \) satisfying</p>

\[ \mu_{ij} = \lambda_{ij} t_{ij}, \]
<p>where \( \lambda_{ij} \) is the hazard rate and \( t_{ij} \) is the total
exposure time for group \( i \) at age \( j \).  In words, the expected
number of deaths is the product of the death rate by exposure time.</p>

<p>A word of caution about units of measurement: the hazard rates must
be interpreted in the same units of time that we have used to measure
exposure.  In our example we measure time in years
and therefore the \( \lambda_{ij} \) represent rates per person-year
of exposure.  If we had measured time in months the \( \lambda_{ij} \)
would represent rates per person-month of exposure, and would be
exactly one twelfth the size of the rates per person-year.</p>

<p>To model the rates we use a log link, so that the linear predictor
becomes</p>

\[ \eta_{ij} = \log \mu_{ij} = \log \lambda_{ij} + \log t_{ij}, \]
<p>the sum of two parts, \( \log t_{ij} \), an <i>offset</i> or known part of the linear
predictor, and \( \log \lambda_{ij} \), the log of the hazard rates of
interest.</p>

<p>Finally, we introduce a log-linear model for the hazard rates,
of the usual form</p>

\[ \log \lambda_{ij} = \boldsymbol{x}_{ij}'\boldsymbol{\beta}, \]
<p>where \( \boldsymbol{x}_{ij} \) is a vector of covariates. In case you are wondering
what happened to the baseline hazard, we have folded it into
the vector of parameters \( \boldsymbol{\beta} \). The vector of covariates \( \boldsymbol{x}_{ij} \)
may include a constant, a set of dummy variables representing the
age groups (i.e. the shape of the hazard by age), a set of dummy
variables representing the birth cohorts (i.e. the change in the
hazard over time) and even a set of cross-product dummies representing
combinations of ages and birth cohorts (i.e. interaction effects).</p>

<p>Table <a href='#t_7_2'>7.2</a> shows the deviance for the five possible models
of interest, including the null model, the two one-factor models,
the two-factor additive model, and the two-factor model with an
interaction, which is saturated for these data.</p>

<h4>7.5.3 The Equivalent Survival Models</h4>
<p>The null model assumes that the hazard is a constant from birth
to age ten and that this constant is the same for all cohorts.
It therefore corresponds to an <i>exponential survival model with
no covariates</i>.  This model obviously does not fit the data,
the deviance of 4239.8 on 20 d.f.&nbsp;is simply astronomical.
The m.l.e.&nbsp;of \( \eta \) is \( -3.996 \) with a standard error of
0.0237. Exponentiating we obtain an estimated hazard rate of
0.0184.  Thus, we expect about 18 deaths per thousand person-years
of exposure.  You may want to verify that 0.0184 is simply the
ratio of the total number of deaths to the total exposure time.
Multiplying 0.0184 by the amount of exposure in each cell of
the table we obtain the expected number of deaths. The deviance
quoted above is simply twice the sum of observed times the log
of observed over expected deaths.</p>

<p>The age model allows the hazard to change from one age group
to another, but assumes that the risk at any given age is the
same for all cohorts. It is therefore equivalent to <i>a piece-wise
exponential survival model with no covariates</i>.  The reduction
in deviance from the null model is 4167.1 on 6 d.f., and is
extremely significant. The risk of death varies substantially
with age over the first few months of life.  In other words the
hazard is clearly not constant.  Note that with a deviance of
72.7 on 14 d.f., this model does not fit the data. Thus,
the assumption that all cohorts are subject to the same risks
does not seem tenable.</p>

<p>Table <a href='#t_7_3'>7.3</a> shows parameter estimates for the
one-factor models \( A \) and \( C \) and for the additive model
\( A+C \) in a format reminiscent of multiple classification
analysis.  Although the \( A \) model does not fit the data, it is
instructive to comment briefly on the estimates. The
constant, shown in parentheses, corresponds to a rate of
\( \exp\{-0.7427\}=0.4758 \), or nearly half a death per person-year
of exposure, in the first month of life. The estimate for
ages 1&ndash;3 months corresponds to a multiplicative effect of
\( \exp\{-1.973\}=0.1391 \), amounting to an 86 percent reduction
in the hazard after surviving the first month of life.
This downward trend continues up to ages 5&ndash;10 years, where
the multiplicative effect is \( \exp\{-5.355\}=0.0047 \), indicating
that the hazard at these ages is only half-a-percent what it
was in the first month of life. You may wish to verify that
the m.l.e.&rsquo;s of the age effects can be calculated directly
from the total number of deaths and the total exposure time
in each age group. Can you calculate the deviance by hand?</p>

<p>Let us now consider the model involving only birth cohort,
which assumes that the hazard is constant from birth to age
ten, but varies from one birth cohort to another.
This model is equivalent to <i>three exponential survival
models</i>, one for each birth cohort. As we would expect,
it is hopelessly inadequate, with a deviance in the thousands,
because it fails to take into account the substantial age
effects that we have just discussed.  It may of of interest,
however, to note the parameter estimates in Table <a href='#t_7_3'>7.3</a>.
As a first approximation, the overall mortality rate for
the older cohort was \( \exp\{-3.899\} = 0.0203 \) or around 20 deaths
per thousand person-years of exposure. The multiplicative effect
for the cohort born in 1960&ndash;67 is \( \exp\{-0.3020\}=0.7393 \),
indicating a 26 percent reduction in overall mortality.
However, the multiplicative effect for the youngest cohort
is \( \exp\{0.0742\}=1.077 \), suggesting an eight percent <i>increase</i>
in overall mortality. Can you think of an explanation for this
apparent anomaly? We will consider the answer after we discuss the
next model.</p>

<p>Consider now the additive model with effects of both age and cohort,
where the hazard rate is allowed to vary with age and may differ
from one cohort to another, but the age (or cohort) effect is
assumed to be the same for each cohort (or age).
This model is equivalent to a <i>proportional hazards model</i>, where
we assume a common shape of the hazard by age, and let cohort
affect the hazard proportionately at all ages.  Comparing the
proportional hazards model with the age model we note a reduction in
deviance of 66.5 on two d.f., which is highly significant.
Thus, we have strong evidence of cohort effects net of age.
On the other hand, the attained deviance of 6.2 on 12 d.f.&nbsp;is clearly
not significant, indicating that the proportional hazards model
provides an adequate description of the patterns of mortality by
age and cohort in Colombia.  In other words, the assumption of
proportionality of hazards is quite reasonable, implying that the
decline in mortality in Colombia has been the same at all ages.</p>

<p>Let us examine the parameter estimates on the right-most column
of Table <a href='#t_7_3'>7.3</a>. The constant is the baseline hazard at
ages 0&ndash;1 months for the earliest cohort, those born in 1941&ndash;59.
The age parameters representing the baseline hazard are practically
unchanged from the model with age only, and trace the dramatic
decline in mortality from birth to age ten, with half the
reduction concentrated in the first year of life.  The cohort
affects adjusted for age provide a more reasonable picture of the
decline in mortality over time.  The multiplicative effects for the
cohorts born in 1960&ndash;67 and 1068&ndash;76 are \( \exp\{-0.3243\}= 0.7233 \)
and \( \exp\{-0.4784\} = 0.6120 \), corresponding
to mortality declines of 28 and 38 percent at every age,
compared to the cohort born in 1941&ndash;59.
This is a remarkable decline in infant and child mortality,
which appears to have been the same at all ages. In other words,
neonatal, post-neonatal, infant and toddler mortality have all
declined by approximately 38 percent across these cohorts.</p>

<p>The fact that the gross effect for the youngest cohort was
positive but the net effect is substantially negative can be
explained as follows.
Because the survey took place in 1976,
children born between 1968 and 76 have been exposed mostly
to mortality at younger ages, where the rates are
substantially higher than at older ages.
For example a child born in 1975 would have been exposed
only to mortality in the first year of life.
The gross effect ignores this fact and thus overestimates the
mortality of this group at ages zero to ten.
The net effect adjusts correctly for the increased risk at
younger ages, essentially comparing the mortality of this cohort
to the mortality of earlier cohorts when they had the same ages,
and can therefore unmask the actual decline.</p>

<p>A final caveat on interpretation: the data are based on
retrospective reports of mothers who were between the ages of 15
and 49 at the time of the interview. These women provide a
representative sample of both mothers and births for recent
periods, but a somewhat biased sample for older periods.
The sample excludes mothers who have died before the interview,
but also women who were older at the time of birth of the
child. For example births from 1976, 1966 and 1956 come from
mothers who were under 50, under 40 and under 30 at the time
of birth of the child. A more careful analysis of the data
would include age of mother at birth of the child as an
additional control variable.</p>

<h4>7.5.4 Estimating Survival Probabilities</h4>
<p>So far we have focused attention on the hazard or mortality rate,
but of course, once the hazard has been calculated it becomes an
easy task to calculate cumulative hazards and therefore
survival probabilities. Table <a href='#t_7_4'>7.4</a> shows the results
of just such an exercise, using the parameter estimates for
the proportional hazards model in Table <a href='#t_7_3'>7.3</a>.</p>

<p>Consider first the baseline group, namely the cohort of children
born before 1960.  To obtain the log-hazard for each age group
we must add the constant and the age effect, for example the log-hazard
for ages 1&ndash;3 months is \( -0.4485-1.973=-2.4215 \). This gives the
numbers in column (3) of Table <a href='#t_7_3'>7.3</a>.  Next we exponentiate
to obtain the hazard rates in column (4), for example the rate
for ages 1&ndash;3 months is \( \exp\{-2.4215\}=0.0888 \).
Next we calculate the cumulative hazard, multiply the hazard
by the width of the interval and summing across intervals.
In this step it is crucial to express the width of the interval
in the same units used to calculate exposure, in this case years.
Thus, the cumulative hazard at then end of ages 1&ndash;3 months
is \( 0.6386\times1/12 + 0.0888\times2/12 = 0.0680 \). Finally,
we change sign and exponentiate to calculate the survival function.
For example the baseline survival function at 3 months is
\( \exp\{-0.0680\} = 0.9342 \).</p>

<p>To calculate the survival functions shown in columns (7) and (8)
for the other two cohorts we could multiply the baseline hazards by
\( \exp\{-0.3242\} \) and \( \exp\{-0.4874\} \) to obtain the hazards
for cohorts 1960&ndash;67 and 1968&ndash;76, respectively, and then repeat
the steps described above to obtain the survival functions.
This approach would be necessary if we had time-varying effects,
but in the present case we can take advantage of a simplification
that obtains for proportional hazard models. Namely, the survival
functions for the two younger cohorts can be calculated as the
baseline survival function <i>raised</i> to the relative risks
\( \exp\{-0.3242\} \) and \( \exp\{-0.4874\} \), respectively.
For example the probability of surviving to age three months
was calculated as 0.9342 for the baseline group, and turns out
to be \( 0.9342^{\exp\{-0.3242\}}=0.9520 \) for the cohort born in
1960&ndash;67, and \( 0.9342^{\exp\{-0.4874\}}=0.9587 \) for the cohort
born in 1968&ndash;76.</p>

<p>Note that the probability of dying in the first year of life has
declined from 106.7 per thousand for children born before 1960
to 78.3 per thousand for children born in 1960&ndash;67 and finally
to 67.5 per thousand for the most recent cohort. Results presented
in terms of probabilities are often more accessible to a wider
audience than results presented in terms of hazard rates.
(Unfortunately, demographers are used to calling the probability
of dying in the first year of life the &lsquo;infant mortality rate&rsquo;.
This is incorrect because the quantity quoted is a probability,
not a rate. In our example the rate varies substantially within
the first year of life. If the probability of dying in the first
year of life is \( q \), say, then the average rate is approximately
\( -\log(1-q) \), which is not too different from \( q \) for small \( q \).)</p>

<p>By focusing on events and exposure, we have been able to combine
infant and child mortality in the same analysis and use all
available information.
An alternative approach could focus on infant mortality (deaths in
the first year of life), and solve the censoring problem by looking
only at children born at least one year before the survey,
for whom the survival status at age one is know. One could then
analyze the probability of surviving to age one using ordinary
logit models.
A complementary analysis could then look at survival from age one
to five, say, working with children born at least five years
before the survey who survived to age one, and then analyzing whether
or not they further survive to age five, using again a logit model.
While simple, this approach does not make full use of the
information, relying on cases with complete (uncensored) data.
Cox and Oakes&nbsp;(1980) show that this so-called reduced sample approach
can lead to inconsistencies. Another disadvantage of this approach
is that it focuses on survival to key ages, but cannot examine
the shape of the hazard in the intervening period.</p>

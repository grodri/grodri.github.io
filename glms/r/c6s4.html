<h2 class="first">6.4 The Sequential Logit Model</h2>
<p>We now fit the <em>hierarchical</em> logit model described in the
notes. Because the term hierarchical has come to be closely associated
with multilevel models, I now prefer calling this model the
<em>sequential</em> logit model, reflecting the fact that the model
proceeds as if decisions were made in a sequence of stages.</p>
<p>This model is not to be confused with the <em>nested</em> logit
model, a term used in econometrics to refer to a random-utility model
where the errors within subsets of choices are correlated and the
predictors include alternative-specific variables. Our approach is much
simpler, but doesn’t have a strict utility maximization
interpretation.</p>
<p>We assume that women first decide whether to use a method or not, and
model this choice using a conventional logit model. We then focus
exclusively on women who use a method, and model their choice of
sterilization or another method using another conventional logit model.
(I told you this would be simpler :)</p>

<h3>The Decision to Use</h3>
<p>We continue to use the same dataset as in the previous sections.
<span class="stata">All we need to get started is a variable to identify
users of contraception.</span></p>

<h3>The Choice of Method Among users</h3>

<div id="comparing-model-likelihoods-and-deviances"
class="section level3">
<h3>Comparing Model Likelihoods and Deviances</h3>
<p>To obtain the log-likehood for the sequential model we simply add the
log-likelihoods for each stage. We can then compare this to the
log-likelihood for a saturated multinomial model to get a sequential
logit deviance. We can use <code>multinom()</code> for the saturated
multinomial, but we can also run two sequential logits with age as a
factor using <code>glm()</code>. Because these functions use individual
and grouped data log-likelihoods, as noted earlier, we will stick with
<code>glm()</code> for simplicity.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; use_sat &lt;- glm(cbind(ster + other, none) ~ ageg, family=binomial, data=cuse)
&gt; ster_sat &lt;- glm(cbind(ster, other) ~ ageg, family=binomial, data=cuse)
&gt; dev = -2*(logLik(use) + logLik(ster) - logLik(use_sat) - logLik(ster_sat))
&gt; data.frame(deviance=dev, df=8, pvalue=pchisq(dev, 8, lower.tail=FALSE))</code></pre>
<pre><code>  deviance df     pvalue
1 16.89298  8 0.03124295</code></pre>
<p>The deviance of 16.89 on 8 d.f. is a bit better (lower) than the
comparable multinomial logit model of <a href="c2s6">Section 6.2</a>
with linear and quadratic effects of age, which was ??? although the
difference is small and we have some evidence that the model does not
fit the data. We will build a plot to examine where the lack of fit
comes from.</p>
</div>
<div id="plotting-observed-and-fitted-logits" class="section level3">
<h3>Plotting Observed and Fitted Logits</h3>
<p>We now produce a figure similar to 6.1, but for the sequential logit
model. We could produce <em>observed</em> logits from logit models
treating age as a factor with seven levels, but we can easily compute
these “by hand”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; cuse &lt;- mutate(cuse, obs_u=log((ster+other)/none), obs_s=log(ster/other))</code></pre>
<p>We can then plot observed versus fitted logits for each equation:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; library(ggplot2)
&gt; fit_u &lt;- function(x) cbind(rep(1,length(x)),x,x^2) %*% coef(use)
&gt; fit_s &lt;- function(x) cbind(rep(1,length(x)),x,x^2) %*% coef(ster)
&gt; png(&quot;fig62r.png&quot;, width=500, height=400)
&gt; ggplot(cuse, aes(age, obs_u)) + geom_point(color=&quot;green&quot;) + 
+   geom_point(mapping=aes(age, obs_s), color=&quot;red&quot;) +
+   geom_function(fun=fit_u, xlim=c(17.5, 47.5), color=&quot;green&quot;) + 
+   geom_function(fun=fit_s, xlim=c(17.5, 47.5),  color=&quot;red&quot;) + xlim(c(15,50)) +
+   annotate(geom=&quot;text&quot;, x=49, y=fit_u(48), label=&quot;use&quot;)  +
+   annotate(geom=&quot;text&quot;, x=49, y=fit_s(48), label=&quot;ster&quot;) +
+   ggtitle(&quot;Contraceptive Use by Age&quot;, subtitle=&quot;Sequential Logits&quot;)
&gt; dev.off()</code></pre>
<pre><code>png 
  2 </code></pre>
<p><img src="fig62r.png" class="img-responsive center-block r" /></p>
<p>We see that the two quadratics fit reasonably well, except for
overestimating the probability of sterilization among contraceptive
users at ages 15 to 19, a problem similar to that noted in the
multinomial logit model. We could easily remedy this deficiency by
adding a dummy variable for teenagers in the second-stage model.</p>
<p><em>Exercise</em>. In the next section we will study ordered logit
models. You may want to try fitting an ordered logit model to this
dataset treating the three choices as ordered in terms of contraceptive
effectiveness.</p>

<h3>6.4 The Sequential Logit Model</h3>
<p>
We now fit the hierarchical logit model described in the notes. 
Because the term <i>hierarchical</i> has come to be closely associated with 
multilevel models, I now prefer calling this model the <i>sequential</i> 
logit model, reflecting the fact that the model proceeds as if decisions 
were made in a sequence of stages.
</p>
<p>
This model is not to be confused with the <i>nested</i> logit model, 
a term used in econometrics to refer to a random-utility model where 
the errors within subsets of choices are correlated and the predictors 
include alternative-specific variables. Our approach is much simpler, 
but doesn't have a strict utility maximization interpretation.
</p>
<p>
We assume that women first decide whether or not to use a method, 
and  we model this choice using a conventional logit model. We then focus 
exclusively on women who use a method, and model their choice of 
sterilization or another method using another conventional logit model. 
(I told you this would be simpler :)
</p>
<h4>The Decision to Use</h4>
<p>
We continue to use the same data frame. All we need is to construct
the response matrices that correspond to each stage. Here is the
standard logit model for the contrast between any method and no method:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> cuse$A <- cbind(cuse[,"ster"] + cuse[,"other"], cuse[,"none"])

> sla <- glm(A ~ age + agesq, data=cuse, family=binomial)

> summary(sla)

Call:
glm(formula = A ~ age + agesq, family = binomial, data = cuse)

> b <- coef(sla)

> -0.5*b["age"]/b["agesq"]
     age 
34.65384 
</pre>
<p>
The estimates indicate that the odds of using contraception 
(sterilization or other method as opposed to no method) 
increase with age to reach a maximum at 34.7 and then decline. 
This is more easily appreciated in a graph, which we will do below.
</p>
<h4>The Choice of Method Among Users</h4>
<p>
For the second step we look just at current users, and model the logit 
of the conditional probability of being sterilized given that the 
woman uses contraception as a quadratic function of age:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> cuse$S.A <- cbind(cuse[,"ster"], cuse[,"other"])

> sls <- glm(S.A ~ age + agesq, data=cuse, family=binomial)

> summary(sls)

Call:
glm(formula = S.A ~ age + agesq, family = binomial, data = cuse)

> b <- coef(sls)

> -0.5*b["age"]/b["agesq"]
     age 
43.55567 
</pre>
<p>
The estimates indicate that the odds of begin sterilized among users 
(sterilization as opposed to other method) increase with age but at a 
decreasing rate, reaching a maximum at 43.6. Again, a picture is worth 
a thousand words and we will plot these curves below.
</p>
<h4>Comparing Model Likelihoods and Deviances</h4>
<p>
Adding the log-likelihoods for the two stages we get the overall 
log-likelihood. The same is true of the deviances:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> x2 <- deviance(sla) + deviance(sls); x2
[1] 16.89298

> pchisq(x2, 8, lower.tail=FALSE)
[1] 0.03124295
</pre>
<p>
We see that the deviance is a bit better (smaller) than for the 
multinomial logit model, although it also reveals significant lack of 
fit. We will build a plot to examine where the lack of fit comes from.
</p>
<h4>Plotting Observed and Fitted Logits</h4>
<p>
We now reproduce  Figure 6.2 in the notes, which is similar to 6.1 
but for the sequential logit model. 
We produce 'observed' logits by direct calculation from the data,
and use the same vector of ages as before to plot smooth curves
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> obs <- log(cbind(cuse$A[,1]/cuse$A[,2], cuse$S.A[,1]/cuse$S.A[,2]))

> B <- rbind(coef(sla),coef(sls))

> fit <- cbind(1, age, age^2) %*% t(B)

> label <- c("any method","ster|any")

> color <- c("green","red")

> png("fig62.png", width=500, height=400)

> plot(cuse$age, obs[,2], type="n", 
+      xlab="age", ylab="log-odds", xlim=c(15,55))

> for (j in 1:2) {
+   points(cuse$age, obs[,j], pch=19, col=color[j])
+   lines(age, fit[,j], col=color[j])
+   text(53, obs[7,j], label=label[j], col=color[j])
+ }

<p class="em text-center">Logits for Any Method and Sterilization|Any Method</p>
<p>
We see that the two quadratics fit reasonably well except for overestimating the
probability of sterilization among contraceptive users at ages 15 to 19, a 
problem similar to that noted in the multinomial logit model. We could easily 
remedy this deficiency by adding a dummy variable for teenagers in the 
second-stage model.
</p>
<p>
<i>Exercise</i>. 
In the next section we will study ordered logit models. You may want
to try fitting an ordered logit model to this dataset treating the three choices
as ordered in terms of contraceptive effectiveness.

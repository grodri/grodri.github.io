<h3>3.6 Multi-factor Models: Model Selection</h3>
<p>
We are now ready to consider a full analysis of the data on contraceptive use
by age, desire for more children, and education.  We can read the data directly
from the course website. For consistency with the previous analysis I will
create a dummy variable for those who want no more children, as well as the
usual response matrix
</p>

</pre>
<p>
There are 19 basic models for these data. Not all of them would be of interest
in any given analysis, but for completeness we will fit them all, effectively
reproducing Table 3.13 in the notes. 
</p>
<p>
To simplify some of the repetitive tasks required to fit so many models,
I'll create a vector with the right-hand-side formulas,
and write a function to fit each model, pasting the response and adding
the family and the data frame before calling <code>glm</code>
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> rhs <- c("1","age", "education", "nomore",
+   "age + education", "age + nomore", "education + nomore", 
+   "age * education", "age * nomore", "education * nomore", 
+   "age + education + nomore",
+   "age * education + nomore", "age * nomore + education", 
+   "age + education * nomore", "age * (education + nomore)", 
+   "education * (age + nomore)", "(age + education) * nomore", 
+   "age*education*nomore - age:education:nomore")

> fit <- function(lp) glm(paste("Y",lp,sep="~"),family=binomial,data=cuse)
</pre>
<p>
Now we simply loop, storing the results in a list
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> models <- vector("list",length(rhs))

> for(i in 1:length(rhs)){
+   models[[i]] <- fit(rhs[i])
+ }
</pre>
<p>
Finally I use <code>lapply</code> to extract the  deviances and df,
just as before, adding the right-hand-sides to identify the models.
The result is Table 3.13:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> data.frame(
+   model = rhs,  #unlist(lapply(lapply(models,formula),deparse)),
+   deviance = round(unlist(lapply(models,deviance)),2),
+   df = unlist(lapply(models,df.residual))
+ )

<h4>The Three-Factor Additive Model</h4>
<p>
The first model of interest here is the three-factor additive model,
showing the effect of each factor net of the other two:

</pre>
<p>
Contraceptive use differs by each of these factors, even when we compare women 
who fall in the same categories of the other two. For example the odds of using
contraception are 38% higher among women with some education than among women with 
no education in the same age group and category of desire for more children.
</p>
<p>
The deviance of 29.92 on 10 d.f. tells us that this model does not fit the data, 
so the assumption that logit differences by one variable are the same across 
categories of the other two is suspect. 
</p>
<h4>The Model with One Interaction Effect</h4>
<p>
Of the three models with one interaction term, the one that achieves the largest
improvement in fit compared to the additive model is the model with an age by 
nomore interaction, where the difference in logits between women who want and 
do not want more children varies by age.

<p>
Make sure you know how to interpret all of these coefficients. For example the 
ratio of the odds of using contraception among women who want no more children
relative to those who want more in the same category of education is 1.07 among 
women under age 25, but 3.9 times more (giving an odds ratio of 4.2) among women 
in their forties. 
</p>
<p>
As noted in the previous section, I highly recommend combining the main effects 
and interactions to show the effect of wanting no more children in each age group.
This is easily done from the coefficients themselves:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> exp( b["nomore"] + c(0,b[grep(":nomore",names(b))]) )
                age25-29:nomore age30-39:nomore age40-49:nomore 
       1.068461        1.384584        3.250737        4.169907 
</pre>
<p>
Here and above I used <code>grep</code> to select the coefficients whose names
include "nomore" (the main effects and interactions) or ":nomore" (just the
interactions). This is safer than using numeric indices. 
</p>
<p>
To aid in interpretation and model criticism we can plot the observed and fitted
logits, effectively reproducing Figure 3.4. Because we will need more than one plot, 
I will encapsulate the calculations in a function that takes a model fit as
argument, and plots the observed and fitted logits 
</p>
<pre class='r'>
plotmod <- function(model,...) {
  wants <- c("more","nomore")
  obs <- qlogis(cuse$using/cuse$n) # observed logits
  agem <- c(20, 27.5, 35, 45)[as.numeric(cuse$age)] 
  col <- c("green","red")[cuse$nomore+1]
  pch <- 14 + as.numeric(cuse$education) # square and circle
  plot(agem, obs, col=col, pch=pch, xlab="Age", ylab="Logit", xlim=c(20,50), ...)
  fv = predict(model)
  for(nomore in 0:1) {
    for(education in c("low","high")) {
      lty <- ifelse(education == "low", "dashed", "solid")
      select <- which(cuse$nomore == nomore & cuse$education == education)
      lines(agem[select], fv[select],lty=lty)
      j <- select[length(select)]
      label <- paste(wants[nomore+1],education,sep=":")
      text(46, fv[j], labels=label, pos=4, cex=0.8)

    }
  }
  invisible(NULL)
}
</pre>
<p>
So here's the plot for the model in Figure 3.4
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> model <- models[[ match("age * nomore + education",rhs) ]]

> plotmod( model, main="Figure 3.4: Contraceptive Use by Age, Education and Desire")

> mtext("Model with Age by Desire Interaction", side=3)
</pre>
<img src="fig34.png" class="img-responsive center-block"/>
<p>
The plot shows clearly how contraceptive use is higher among women who want
no more children in their thirties and forties, and how it is a bit higher
among educated women than among their less educated counterparts in the same
age and preference category. The fit, however, leaves a bit to be desired 
at the extreme ages, particularly among women in their forties who want more children.
</p>
<h4>All Three Two-Factor Interactions</h4>
<p>
As explained in the notes, there is some evidence that education may interact
with the other variables. The model with all two-factor interactions provides
the best fit, with a deviance of 2.44 on three d.f., bit is substantially
more complex. 
</p>
<p>
Rather than provide parameter estimates, I will reproduce Figure 3.5 in the notes,
which provides some hints on how the model could be simlpified.  Thanks to
our <code>plotmod()</code> function, this is very easy:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> model <- models[[18]]

> plotmod(model, main="Figure 3.5: Contraceptive Use by Age, Education and Desire")

> mtext("Model with Three Two-Factor Interactions", side=3)
</pre>
<img src="fig35.png" class="img-responsive center-block"/>
<p>
A picture is indeed worth a thousand words. We see that among women who want no more
children contraceptive use increases almost linearly with age (in the logit scale)
with no differences by education except in the oldest age group, where use flattens
for women with no education. Among women who do want more children contraceptive use
is generally lower, increases more slowly with age, there are some differences by
education, and these are higher among older women. There's also a hint of curvature 
by age for women with no education who want more children. 
</p>
<h4>A Parsimonious Model</h4>
<p>
These observations suggest ways to simplify the model. The age interactions are quite
simple: the increase with age is steeper among women who want no more children, and
the difference by education is larger among women in their forties. Similarly, the
educational difference is larger in use for spacing and among older women.
</p>
<p>
One way to capture these features is to use a quadratic on age, allow the slope (but
not the curvature) to vary by desire for more children, and introduce effects of
education only for spacing and after age 40 (and thus not for limiting before age 40).
To facilitate interpretation of the resulting parameters I center age around 30:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> cuse$agem <- c(20, 27.5, 35, 45)[as.numeric(cuse$age)]

> cuse$agec   <- cuse$agem - 30

> cuse$agecsq <- cuse$agec^2

> cuse$educ.spacing <- as.numeric(cuse$education == "high")*(1 - cuse$nomore)

> cuse$educ.at40p   <- as.numeric(cuse$education == "high" & cuse$age == "40-49")

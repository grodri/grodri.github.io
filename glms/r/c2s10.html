<h3>2.10 Transforming the Data</h3> 
<p>
The final section in this chapter deals with Box-Cox transformations.
To avoid problems with negative values of the response variable,
we add 1/2 to all observations:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> y <- change + 0.5
</pre>
<h4>The Box-Cox Transformation</h4> 
<p>
Venables and Ripley's MASS library has a handy <code>boxcox</code>
function that computes and plots the profile log-likelihood for a
range of possible transformations going from -2 to 2. The main
argument to the function is a linear model fit. We'll try it with
the analysis of covariance model that treats setting linearly and
effort as a factor:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> require(MASS)
> bcm <- lm(y ~ setting + effort.g)
> bc <- boxcox(bcm)
> dev.print(png,file="fig28.png",width=500,height=400)
RStudioGD 
        2 
</pre>

<p class="em text-center">Figure 2.8. Box-Cox Profile Log-likelihood</p> 
<p>
As you can see from the graph, the optimal transformation has a 
parameter somewhat below 1, suggesting something like a square 
root transformation, but the profile log-likelihood is
rather flat, and leaving the data untransformed does not lower
the log-likelihood significantly.  
</p>
<p>
The <code>boxcox</code> function returns a list with x as the 
parameter and y as the corresponding log-likelihood.
We can find the approximate mle as the x-value that yields
the maximum: 0.67.
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> bc$x[bc$y==max(bc$y)]
[1] 0.6666667
</pre>
<p>
A large sample test for no transformation 
compares the log-likelihoods at one and at the maximum.
Unfortunately 1 is not one of the generated x-values,
but we can call the function with a single parameter value
to just evaluate the log-likelihood:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> bc0 <- boxcox(mbc, lambda=1, plotit=F)
</pre>
<p>
The chi-squared value of 3.65 is below the five-percent critical
value, showing that we have no evidence against leaving the
data in the original scale. To test for a log-transformation
you could use the same technique with <code>lambda=0</code>,
but it is clear from the plot that using logs would produce 
a substantially lower log-likelihood. 
</p>
<h4>Atkinson's Score Test</h4> 
<p>
Our final calculation involves Atkinson's score test, which requires
fitting the auxiliary variable given in Equation 2.31 in the notes.
We compute the geometric mean, which we call <code>gmean</code>,
use this to compute the auxiliary variable <code>atkinson</code>, 
and then fit the extended model:
</p>
<p>
The coefficient of the auxiliary variable is 0.59, so the optimal
power is approximately 1-0.59 = 0.41, suggesting again that 
something like a square root transformation might be indicated.
The associated <i>t</i>-statistic is significant at the two percent level,
but the more accurate likelihood ratio test statistic calculated earlier
was only borderline.  Thus, we do not have strong evidence against 
keeping the response in the original scale.
</p>
<p>
<i>Exercise:</i> Try the Box-Tidwell procedure described in Section 
2.10.4 of the notes to see if a transformation of social setting would 
be indicated.

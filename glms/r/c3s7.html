<h3>3.7 Other Choices of Link</h3>
<p>
Two brief notes on the latent variable formulation of binary response models 
and the use of alternative links. First we plot three different links in a 
standardized scale. Second we compare logit and probit estimates for a model 
of contraceptive use.
</p>
<h4>Three Link Functions</h4>
<p>
Let us reproduce Figure 3.7, which shows the logit, probit and complementary 
log-log link, after standardizing the latent variable so it has mean 0 and 
variance 1. The probit link is based on the standard normal distribution, 
which is already standardized. The logit link is based on the standard 
logistic distribution, which has mean 0 and variance &pi;<sup>2</sup>/3. 
The c-log-log link is based on the extreme value (log Weibull) distribution, 
with mean 0.577 and variance &pi;<sup>2</sup>/6.

<p>
As you can see, the logit and probit links are virtually indistinguisable. 
The c-log-log link looks different, but one would still need very large sample 
sizes to be able to distinguish it from the others.
</p>
<h4>A Probit Model</h4>
<p>
We will fit a probit model to the data on contraceptive use by age and desire 
for more children. Following the notes we will pick the specification where 
age is treated linearly and we include an interaction between age and desire 
for no more children. To simplify interpretation of the interaction we center 
age at 30 years. We use the <code>glm</code> command to get a deviance, see
also <code>bprobit</code> for grouped data and <code>probit</code> for
individual data.

<p>
Probit coefficients can be interpreted in terms of a standardized latent 
variable representing a propensity to use contraception, or the difference 
in expected utilities between using and not using contraception.
</p>
<p>
We see that the propensity among women who want more children increases with 
age at the rate of just over one tenth of a standard deviation per year. 
More interestingly, the propensity is 0.44 standard deviations higher among 
women who want no more children than among those who want more at age 30. 
This difference increases by 0.03 standard deviations per year of age, so it 
is 0.13 standard deviations at age 20 but 0.74 standard deviations at age 40. 
As a result, the propensity to use contraception among women who want no more 
children is 0.04 standard deviations higher per year of age.
</p>
<p>
It may be of interest to compare logit and probit coefficients. One way to 
compare them is to divide the logit coefficients by p/&radic;(3) = 1.8. 
This standardizes the logistic latent variable to have variance one, so the 
coefficients have the same interpretation. The first two columns in the table 
below show that the two sets of coefficients are in fact very similar

<p>
Gelman and Hill, following Amemiya, recommend dividing by 1.6. This factor was 
chosen by trial and error to make the transformed logistic approximate the 
standard normal distribution over a wide domain. As shown in the third column 
above, it gives a somewhat closer approximation to the probit coefficients in 
our example, particularly for the interaction term. Of course the difference 
between dividing by 1.8 or 1.6 is not going to be large.

<h2>4  Models for Count Data</h2>
<p>
This unit illustrates the use of Poisson regression for modeling 
count data. We will be using the <code>glm</code> function with
family <code>poisson</code> to fit the standard models. We will
then consider extensions to accomodate extra-Poisson variation,
reviewing the overdispersed Poisson, negative binomial, and
zero-inflated Poisson models.
</p>
<h3>4.3 A Poisson Model for Counts</h3>
<p>
We will use the data from Fiji on children ever born that appear 
on Table 4.1 of the lecture notes. The data are available on our 
datasets page at http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets in 
both plain text and Stata formats. We will read the Stata file:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> require(foreign)

> ceb <- read.dta("http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/ceb.dta")

> nrow(ceb)
[1] 70

> names(ceb)
[1] "i"    "dur"  "res"  "educ" "mean" "var"  "n"   
</pre>
<p>
  The file has 70 observations, one for each cell in the table. 
Each observation has a sequence number, numeric codes for marriage 
duration, residence and education, the mean and variance of children 
ever born, and the number of women in the cell. 
</p>
<h4>Mean-Variance Relationship</h4>
<p>
  We start by doing Figure 4.1, plotting the cell variances versus 
the cell means using a log-log-scale for cell with at least 20 cases.
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> png("c4fig1.png",width=500,height=400)

> s <- subset(ceb, n >= 20) 

> plot(log(s$mean), log(s$var), xlab="log(Mean CEB)",  ylab="log(Variance of CEB)",
+       main="Figure 4.1. Mean-Variance Relationship")

          1 
</pre>

<p>
Clearly the variance increases with the mean. Most of the points lie 
below the 45 degree line, indicating that the variance is not exactly 
equal to the mean. Still, the assumption of proportionality brings us 
much closer to the data than the assumption of constant variance.
</p>
<h4>Response, Offset and Predictors</h4>
<p>
The dataset does not have information about the number of children 
ever born (CEB) for each woman, but it turns out we can still model 
the mean by working with the cell totals and introducing the log of 
the number of women in the cell as an offset.
</p>
<p>
If the number of CEB to one woman in a given cell is a Poisson random 
variable with mean (and variance) &mu;, then the number born to all 
n women in that cell is a Poisson r.v. with mean (and variance) n&mu;.
The log of the expected sum is log(n)+log(&mu;), and consists of a 
known offset and the quantity we are interested in modeling. See the 
notes for further details
</p>
<p>
We therefore start by computing the outcome, the total CEB in each 
cell, and the offset, and then fit the null model which includes
only the offset:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> ceb$y <- round(ceb$mean*ceb$n, 0)

> ceb$os = log(ceb$n)  

> m0 <- glm( y ~ offset(os), data=ceb, family=poisson)

> summary(m0)

Call:
glm(formula = y ~ offset(os), family = poisson, data = ceb)

</pre>
<p>
The constant is the log of the mean number of children ever born. 
Exponentiating we see that the estimated mean is almost four children 
per woman. The estimate coincides with the sample mean, as we 
verified by averaging the cell means using the number of women 
in each cell as a weight (and allowing for rounding).
</p>
<p>
The deviance of 3,732 on 69 d.f. gives a clear indication that the 
model doesn't fit the data. The hypothesis that the expected number 
of CEB is the same for all women regardless of marriage duration, 
residence and education, is soundly rejected,  
</p>
<h4>One-Factor Models</h4>
<p>
Next we fit the three one-factor models, starting with residence:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> m1r <- glm( y ~ res + offset(os), data=ceb, family=poisson)

> summary(m1r)

Call:

<p>
The estimates show that women in urban and rural areas have on 
average 16 and 26% more children than women in Suva. The model 
chi-squared of 73 on 2 d.f. tells us that this model is a significant 
improvement over the null. The deviance, still in the thousands, 
tells us that this model is far from fitting the data.
</p>
<p>
Now for education:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> m1e <- glm( y ~ educ + offset(os), data=ceb, family=poisson)

<p>
The estimates show that the number of CEB declines substantially 
with education. Women with secondary education or more have 71% 
fewer children than women with no education (or only 29% as many). 
The educational differential is highly significant, but this model 
doesn't fit the data.
</p>
<p>
Finally here's duration:

<pre class='r'>
> m1d <-  glm( y ~ dur + offset(os), data=ceb, family=poisson)

<p>
Not surprisingly the number of CEB is much higher for women who have 
been married longer. This is by far the most important predictor of 
CEB, with a chi-squared of 3,566 on just 5 d.f. In fact, a 
demographer wouldn't even have looked at models that did not include 
a control for duration of marriage. It's nice to see that Poisson 
regression can uncover the obvious :) 
Note that this model still doesn't fit the data.
</p>
<p>
The deviances given in this section are pretty close to the deviances 
in Table 4.3 of the notes. You may notice small differences due to 
the use of different rounding procedures. In the notes we multiplied 
the mean CEB by the number of women and retained a few decimals. Here 
we rounded the total number of CEB to the nearest integer. If you 
omit the rounding you will reproduce the results in the notes exactly.
</p>
<h4>Two-Factor Models</h4>
<p>
We now consider models that take two of the three factors into 
account. Following the notes we consider only models that include 
duration of marriage, an essential control when we study cumulative 
fertility. This leaves two models with main effects of two factors, 
and another two models that add one interaction.
</p>
<p>
Because we are only interested in deviances I will not summarize
every model but simply print the deviance instead.
So here are the additive models:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> m2dr <- glm( y ~ dur + res + offset(os), data=ceb, family=poisson)

> deviance(m2dr)
[1] 120.6804

> m2de <- glm( y ~ dur + educ + offset(os), data=ceb, family=poisson)

> deviance(m2de)
[1] 100.1917
</pre>
<p>
And here are the models with one interaction:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> m2dxr <- glm( y ~ dur * res + offset(os), data=ceb, family=poisson)

> deviance(m2dxr)
[1] 108.8965

> m2dxe <- glm( y ~ dur * res + offset(os), data=ceb, family=poisson)

> deviance(m2dxe)
[1] 108.8965
</pre>
<p>
The best fit so far is the model that includes duration and 
education, but it exhibits significant lack of fit, with a 
chi-squared of 84.5 on 46 d.f.
</p>
<h4>The Three-Factor Additive Model</h4>
<p>
We are now ready to look at models that include all three factors. 
We start with the additive model:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> m3 <- glm( y ~ dur + res + educ + offset(os), data=ceb, family=poisson)

> summary(m3)

Call:
glm(formula = y ~ dur + res + educ + offset(os), family = poisson, 
    data = ceb)

<p>
  This model passes the goodness of fit hurdle, with a deviance of 
70.67 on 59 d.f. and a corresponding P-value of 0.14, so we have no 
evidence against this model.  
</p>
<p>
Briefly the estimates indicate that the number of CEB increases 
rapidly with marital duration; in each category of residence and 
education women married 15-19 years have five times as many children 
as those married less than five years. Women who live in urban and 
rural areas have 12% and 16% more children than women who live in 
Suva and have the same marriage duration and education. Finally, 
more educated women have fewer children, with women with secondary 
or more education reporting 27% fewer children than women with no 
education who live in the same type of place of residence and have 
been married just as long.
</p>
<h4>Three-Factor Models with Interactions</h4>
<p>
We now put the additive model to some "stress tests" by considering 
all possible interactions.  The issue here is whether the deviance
of 70.67 is uniformly distributed through its 50 d.f. or concetrated
of a few d.f. that might be captured by an interaction.

</pre>
<p>
These calculations complete Table 4.3 in the notes. 
I reported the deviances for consistency with the notes, but could 
just as well have reported likelihood ratio tests comparing each of 
these models to the additive model. Make sure you know how to use 
the output to test, for example, whether we need to add a duration 
by education interaction. It should be clear from the list of 
deviances that we don't need to add any of these terms. We conclude 
that the additive model does a fine job indeed.
</p>
<p>
it's important to note that the need for interactions depends 
exactly on what's being modeled. Here we used the log link, so 
all effects are relative. In this scale no interactions are needed.
If we used the identity link we would be modeling the actual number 
of children ever born, and all effects would be absolute. In that 
scale we would need, at the very least, interactions with duration 
of marriage. See the notes for further discussion.
</p>

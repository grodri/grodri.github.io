<h1 class="first">3. Logit Models</h1>
<p>In this chapter we discuss fitting logistic regression models by
maximum likelihood. In R this task is accomplished by the
<code>glm()</code> function with family <code>binomial()</code>.</p>
<div id="the-comparison-of-two-groups" class="section level2">
<h2>3.3 The Comparison of Two Groups</h2>
<p>Our discussion starts with simple comparisons of proportions in two
groups. For simplicity we use grouped data, but the key ideas apply to
individual data as well.</p>
<div id="a-2-by-2-table" class="section level3">
<h3>A 2 by 2 Table</h3>
<p>Consider the data on contraceptive use by desire for more children on
Table 3.2 (page 14 of the notes). We can read these data into our
software as 2 binomial observations. To make life easier, I will enter
desire for more children as a dummy variable that takes the value 1 for
women who want no more children and 0 otherwise.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; library(dplyr)
&gt; cuse &lt;- data.frame(matrix(c(
+ 0, 219, 753,
+ 1, 288, 347), 2, 3, byrow=TRUE))

<div id="testing-homogeneity" class="section level3">
<h3>Testing Homogeneity</h3>
<p>Let us start by fitting the null model. With grouped binomial data
the outcome is a matrix with two columns, representing the number of
“successes” and “failures”, in this case users and non-users of
contraception. The binomial denominator is calculated internally as the
sum of these two columns.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; cuse &lt;- mutate(cuse, Y = cbind(using, notUsing))
&gt; m0 &lt;- glm(Y ~ 1, family=binomial, data = cuse)

<pre><code>[1] 92.64424</code></pre>
<p>The estimate of the constant is simply the logit of the overall
proportion using contraception, say <em>p=y/n</em>, and the standard
error is the square root of <em>1/y + 1/(n-y)</em>. You may want to
check these results by hand. To compute logits you may use
<code>qlogis()</code>, with inverse <code>plogis()</code>, for quantiles
and probabilities of the standard logistic distribution. These
specialized functions are more accurate than just computing
<em>log(p/(1-p))</em>.</p>
<p>The deviance is 91.67 on one d.f., providing ample evidence that the
null model does not fit the data. Thus, we reject the hypothesis that
the probability of using contraception is the same in the two
groups.</p>
<p>An alternative test is Pearson’s chi-squared, which is 92.64 on one
d.f., and leads to the same conclusions. These two tests are
asymptotically equivalent, so they tend to give similar results in large
samples.</p>

<div id="the-odds-ratio" class="section level3">
<h3>The Odds Ratio</h3>
<p>Let us now fit the model with “want no more” children as the
predictor. This model is saturated for this dataset, using two
parameters to model two probabilities:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; m1 &lt;- glm(Y ~ nomore, family=binomial, data=cuse)

    Null deviance: 9.1674e+01  on 1  degrees of freedom

<pre class="r"><code>&gt; exp(coef(m1)[&quot;nomore&quot;])</code></pre>
<pre><code>  nomore 
2.853737 </code></pre>
<p>The constant corresponds to the log-odds of using contraception among
whomen who <em>do</em> want more children, and the coefficient of
<code>nomore</code> is the difference in log-odds between the two
groups.</p>
<p>Exponentiating this coefficient we get an odds ratio of about three.
Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean that “women who want no
more children are three times more likely to use contraception”. There
are two errors in this interpretation.</p>
<p>First, and more importantly, it is the <em>odds</em> of using
contraception among women who want no more children that are three times
those of women who want more, not the probability, which is what’s
usually understood by “likelihood”. The interpretation would be
approximately correct if the event under study was rare, because if
<em>p</em> is small then <em>1-p</em> is close to one and the odds ratio
is approximately the same as the relative risk. Here the observed
proportions are 0.454 and 0.225, and the ratio is 2.01, so women who
want no more children are twice as likely to use contraception as those
who want more.</p>
<p>Second, even if the probability was tripled, that would make the
women three times <em>as</em> likely, or two times <em>more</em> likely,
to use contraception, not three times more likely. In this case the
probability is doubled, and that makes women twice <em>as</em> likely,
not two times <em>more</em> likely.</p>

<div id="testing-significance" class="section level3">
<h3>Testing Significance</h3>
<p>The z-statistic is as reported on page 16 of the notes. Let us square
it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; b &lt;- coef(m1)
&gt; se &lt;- sqrt(diag(vcov(m1)))
&gt; (b[2]/se[2])^2</code></pre>
<pre><code>  nomore 
89.77765 </code></pre>
<p>This is Wald’s chi-squared statistic for the hypothesis that the
coefficient of <code>nomore</code> is zero, or equivalently that the
odds-ratio is one.</p>
<p>We can also compare these models using a likelihood ratio test.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; -2*(logLik(m0) - logLik(m1))</code></pre>
<pre><code>&#39;log Lik.&#39; 91.6744 (df=1)</code></pre>
<p>Can you explain why we get 91.67, which is the deviance of the null
model? <em>Hint:</em> What’s the deviance of the current model?</p>
<p>A third test of the effect of want no more is given by Pearson’s
chi-squared statistic, which we calculated earlier as 92.64. This is
equivalent to the standard z-test for comparing two proportions if you
use the pooled proportion to estimate the standard error.</p>
<p>All three statistics are different, but they are asymptotically
equivalent. In our example they are also close in value and lead to the
same overwhelming rejection of the hypothesis that the probability of
using contraception is the same in the two groups.</p>
</div>
<div id="confidence-intervals" class="section level3">
<h3>Confidence Intervals</h3>
<p>You can obtain a confidence interval in R by calling the
<code>confint()</code> function, which uses a profile log-likelihood.
You can obtain the more conventional confidence intervals by calling
<code>confint.default()</code>. Let us obtain a confidence interval for
the odds ratio using both methods.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; exp(confint(m1,&quot;nomore&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>Waiting for profiling to be done...</code></pre>
<pre><code>   2.5 %   97.5 % 
2.298942 3.548111 </code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; exp(confint.default(m1,&quot;nomore&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>          2.5 %   97.5 %
nomore 2.297258 3.545015</code></pre>
<p>With 95% confidence, the odds of using contraception among women who
want no more kids are between 2.3 and 3.5 times as high as for women who
want more children.</p>
<p>Note that the standard confidence bounds for the odds ratio are
<em>not</em> calculated by adding and subtracting twice its standard
error. Instead, the calculation is done in the logit scale and the
results are then exponentiated. This is done because the normal
approximation is more accurate (and makes more sense) in the logit
scale, which has no range restrictions.</p>
<p><em>Exercise</em>. Calculate the conventional z-test for comparing
the proportions using contraception in the two groups and verify that
the square coincides with Pearson’s chi-squared statistic.</p>

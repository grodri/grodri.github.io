<h3>2.5 Multiple Regression</h3>
<p>
Let us try a multiple regression model with linear and additive effects 
of social setting and program effort, using a plus sign to add terms to
a model formula:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> m2 <- lm(change ~ setting + effort)
> summary(m2)
Call:
lm(formula = change ~ setting + effort)

Residuals:
     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max 
-10.3475  -3.6426   0.6384   3.2250  15.8530 

Coefficients:
            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept) -14.4511     7.0938  -2.037 0.057516 .  
setting       0.2706     0.1079   2.507 0.022629 *  
effort        0.9677     0.2250   4.301 0.000484 ***

Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

Residual standard error: 6.389 on 17 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.7381,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.7073 
F-statistic: 23.96 on 2 and 17 DF,  p-value: 1.132e-05
</pre>
<p>
This time we went directly to the summary function to obtain estimates
and standard errors. Compare the results with Table 2.5. 
</p>
<p>
The estimates suggest that fertility decline increases with social setting, 
about a quarter of a percentage point per point of setting, when we compare 
countries with the same effort. Similarly, fertility declines about one 
percentage point more per point of program effort, when we compare countries 
with the same social setting.
</p>
<p>
It is important to keep in mind that both conclusions are based on the model, 
which assumes linearity and additivity. In fact we can't really compare 
countries which differ exactly by one point in effort and have the same setting, 
so goodness of fit will be a central concern. You may also note that I try to 
avoid using causal language when describing observational data.
</p>
<p>
We can also obtain the hierarchical anova in Table 2.8:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> anova(m2)

<p>
The F-test for a linear effect of setting after taking into account setting
is 18.5 on 1 and 17 d.f., and is the same as the square of the t-statistic
of 4.3 on 17 d.f.
</p>
<h4>Partial Correlations</h4>
<p>
Let us check the partial correlation listed on page 27.
Here's the coefficient for change and effort controlling for setting,
calculated in terms of the proportion of variance explained by effort
out of what setting had left unexplained. The calculation uses our own
<code>rss()</code> function defined earlier:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> sqrt(1 - rss(m2)/rss(m1))
[1] 0.7218626
</pre>
<p>
Another way to calculate this coefficient is in terms of the correlation
between the residuals in models of change on setting and effort on setting:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> cor(resid(lm(change~setting)),
+     resid(lm(effort~setting)))
[1] 0.7218626
</pre>
<p>
Squaring this coefficient we find that program effort is associated with 
about half the variation left in fertility decline in countries with the 
same social setting. (It is common to say "after controlling for social setting", 
but of course we are not able to manipulate any of these variables.)

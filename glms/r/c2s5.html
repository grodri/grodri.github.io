<h2 class="first">2.5 Multiple Regression</h2>
<p>Let us try a multiple regression model with linear and additive
effects of social setting and program effort:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt;     fpe &lt;- read.table(&quot;https://grodri.github.io/datasets/effort.dat&quot;)
&gt; m1 &lt;- lm(change ~ setting, data=fpe) # redone for comparison
&gt; m2 &lt;- lm(change ~ setting + effort, data=fpe)
&gt; summary(m2)</code></pre>

Call:
lm(formula = change ~ setting + effort, data = fpe)

<p>This time we went directly to the <code>summary()</code> and
<code>anova()</code>. Compare the coefficients with Table 2.5 and the
anova with Table 2.7.</p>
<p>The estimates suggest that fertility decline increases with social
setting, about a quarter of a percentage point per point of setting,
when we compare countries with the same effort. Similarly, fertility
declines about one percentage point more per point of program effort,
when we compare countries with the same social setting.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that both conclusions are based on
the model, which assumes linearity and additivity. In fact, we can’t
really compare countries which differ exactly by one point in effort and
have the same setting, so goodness of fit will be a central concern. You
may also note that I try to avoid using causal language when dealing
with observational data.</p>
<p>The F-test for a linear effect of effort after taking into account
setting is 18.5 on 1 and 17 d.f., and is the same as the square of the
t-statistic of 4.3 on 17 d.f.</p>
<div id="partial-correlations" class="section level3">
<h3>Partial Correlations</h3>
<p>Make sure you know how to reproduce the hierarchical anova in Table
2.8 in the notes. Let us check the partial correlation listed on page
27. Here’s the coefficient for change and effort controlling for
setting:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; rss &lt;- function(m) sum(residuals(m)^2)
&gt; sqrt(1 - rss(m2)/rss(m1))</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 0.7218626</code></pre>
<p>Another way to obtain this coefficient is as the correlation between
the residuals of change given setting and effort given setting:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; cor(resid(lm(change~setting, data=fpe)), 
+         resid(lm(effort~setting, data=fpe)))</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 0.7218626</code></pre>
<p>Squaring this coefficient we find that program effort is associated
with about half the variation left in fertility decline in countries
with the same social setting. (It is common to say “after controlling
for social setting”, but of course we are not able to manipulate any of
these variables.)</p>

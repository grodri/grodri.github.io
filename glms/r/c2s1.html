 <h2>2. Linear Models in R </h2>
<p>
We start with the linear models in Chapter 2 of the lecture notes, 
showing how to use the <code>lm()</code> function in R to fit regression, 
analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance models.
</p>
<h3>2.1 The Program Effort Data</h3>
<p>
For a brief description of the program effort data see the lecture notes 
or point your browser to the <a href='../datasets'>datasets</a> page.
The data are available on a text file with a header line containing
variable names, and can be read directly from the web using the
<code>read.table()</code> function:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> fpe <- read.table("http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/effort.dat")
</pre>
<p>
The function produces a data frame which we assign to <code>fpe</code>.
To make sure everything is alright we list the data by simply typing
<code>fpe</code>, which invokes its print method. We have 20 observations
on 3 variables, and the country names serve as row names.
</p>

The course datasets are also available as Stata system files, and can
 be read from R using the <code>read.dta()</code> function in the
<code>foreign</code> package. Datasets for the course problem sets are 
often made available in this format, so I suggest you install that package
and try the function. All you have to do is change the file extension
from ".dat" to ".dta".
</p>
<p>
<i>Note:</i> 
If you try the <code>read.dta()</code> function you will see that it stores 
the country names as a separate variable, whereas <code>read.table()</code>
treats them as row names, which can be used as subscripts in R. That's
easily fixed by typing  <code>row.names(fpe) <- fpe$country</code> to 
use the countries as row names, and <code>fpe$country <- NULL</code> to 
delete the now redundant column. 
</p>
<p>
The next thing we want to do is plot the data for a closer look. 
The importance of becoming familiar with your data before undertaking 
sophisticated analyses cannot be over-emphasized. 
</p>
<p>
The <code>pairs()</code> function created scatterplots of all pairs of 
variables, reproducing  Figure 2.1 in the notes. Obviously only numeric 
variables should be included, but that's not a problem here, and we
could just say <code>pairs(fpe)</code>.  I think, however, that the
plot is easier to read if we use the same order as in the notes,
which we can easily do using the variable names as column subscripts:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> pairs(fpe[,c("change","setting","effort")])
> dev.print(png,"fig21.png",width=500,height=400)

R graphs are displayed on the active graphics device, typically a
graphics window in R or R Studio. To save the graph to a file we can use
the <code>dev.print()</code> function, which takes as first argument 
a  device. In this case I typed <code>png</code> to obtain 
<u>p</u>ortable <u>n</u>etwork <u>g</u>raphics, which are suitable
for display on a web page. The next argument is a file name. I also
specified the width and height of the graph in pixels. 
</p>
<p>
An alternative way to do this is to open a graphics device using the 
<code>png()</code> function, plot to that, and then close the device, 
which effectively saves the file, as shown below. You can verify that 
the two methods give the same result, except that the second method 
does not display the graph.

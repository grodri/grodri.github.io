<h2 class='first'>7.  Survival Models in R</h2> 
<p>
  R has extensive facilities for fitting survival models. 
We will discuss only the use of Poisson regression to fit 
piece-wise exponential survival models.
</p>
 <h3>7.5  Infant and Child Mortality in Colombia</h3> 
<p>
  The datasets page has the original tabulation of children by sex, 
cohort, age and survival status (dead or still alive at interview),
as analyzed by Somoza (1980). 
</p>
<p>
  As is often the case with survival data, a good part of the
effort is to convert the raw data into the counts of events
and exposure needed for analysis.
</p>
  <h4>Data Preparation</h4> 
<p>
  We will start by reading the data and collapsing over sex,
and will then compute events and exposure to reproduce 
Table 7.1 in the lecture notes.
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> require(foreign)

> somoza <- read.dta("http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/somoza.dta")

> s <- aggregate(dead ~ cohort + age, data=somoza, FUN=sum)

> s$alive <- aggregate(alive ~ cohort + age, data=somoza, FUN=sum)[,"alive"]

> s <- s[order(s$cohort, s$age),]
</pre>
<p>
  The next step is to compute exposure time. We proceed by cohort,
sum all dead and alive to get the total number in the cohort, and
then proceed by age subtract those dying or still alive in each
each group to obtain the number entering and exiting each age
group. Exposure is then the number in the mid-point times the 
width of the age group, and I chose to express it in years.
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> w <- c(1,2,3,6,12,36,60,0)/12

> s$exposure <- 0

> for(cohort in levels(s$cohort)) {
+   i <- which(s$cohort == cohort)
+   data <- s[i,]
+   n <- sum(data$alive + data$dead)
+   exit <- n - cumsum(data$alive + data$dead)
+   enter <- c(n, exit[-length(exit)])
+   s[i,"exposure"] <- w*(enter+exit)/2
+ }

> co <- subset(s, age != "10+ years")

> co$age <- factor(co$age) # dropping level 10+

> names(co)[3] <- "deaths"
</pre>
<p>
After calculating exposure I dropped kids older than ten, as we 
are only interested in survival  to age ten. 
I also renamed "dead" to "deaths", which makes more sense.
The data are now ready for analysis.
</p>

<h4>Exponential Survival</h4>
<p>
In preparation for model fitting I calculate the offset or
log of exposure and add it to the data frame. I then fit a
simple exponential model by treating the number of deaths
as Poisson with mean proportional to exposure time and a
constant rate:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> co$os <- log(co$exposure)

> em <- glm(deaths ~ offset(os), family=poisson, data=co)

> summary(em)$coefficients
             Estimate Std. Error   z value Pr(>|z|)
(Intercept) -3.996449 0.02371543 -168.5168        0

> deviance(em)
[1] 4239.871
</pre>
<p>
  Note the astronomical deviance. 
The estimate of the constant happens to be the log of the 
overall mortality rate. Let's verify this fact
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> sum(co$deaths)/sum(co$exposure)
[1] 0.0183808

> exp(coef(em))
(Intercept) 
  0.0183808 
</pre>
<p>
We have an overall mortality rate of 18.4 deaths per
thousand child-years of exposure.
</p>
<h4>Three Exponentials</h4> 
<p>
On to the one-factor models. 
We start with the cohort model, which is equivalent to a separate 
exponential survival model for each cohort:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> emc <- glm(deaths ~ cohort + offset(os), family=poisson, data=co)

> summary(emc)$coefficients
                 Estimate Std. Error    z value     Pr(>|z|)
(Intercept)   -3.89948706 0.04113406 -94.799469 0.000000e+00
cohort1960-67 -0.30203952 0.05733117  -5.268330 1.376702e-07
cohort1968-76  0.07421735 0.05897221   1.258514 2.082060e-01

> deviance(emc)
[1] 4190.709

> exp(coef(emc)[-1]) - 1
cohort1960-67 cohort1968-76 
  -0.26069116    0.07704087 
</pre>
<p>
Compare these results with the gross effect estimates in Table 7.3. 
Note that the hazard rate declined 26% between the 1941-59 and 
1960-67 cohorts, but appears to have increased almost 8% for the 
1968-76 cohort compared to the 1941-59 cohort. 
(We will return to this issue.) 
</p>
<p>
  The astronomical deviance shows that this model does not provide
a reasonable description of the data. It is, however, better than
the model where all cohorts follow the same exponential survival
curve, as evidenced by the reduction in deviance or the Wald test
(I'll write a simple function for this)
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> wald <- function(model,pattern) {
+   loc <- grep(pattern,names(coef(model)))    
+   b <- coef(model)[loc]
+   V <- vcov(model)[loc,loc]
+   t(b) %*% solve(V) %*% b
+ }

> deviance(em) - deviance(emc)
[1] 49.16135

> wald(emc, "cohort")
         [,1]
[1,] 47.99641
</pre>
<p>
Both tests are highly significant, indicating that overall mortality
rates are not the same across cohorts.
</p>
<h4>Piece-Wise Exponential Survival</h4> 
<p>
Now we consider the age model, where the hazard depends on the age 
of the child:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> pwe <- glm(deaths ~ age + offset(os), family=poisson, data=co)

> summary(pwe)$coefficients
                 Estimate Std. Error   z value      Pr(>|z|)
(Intercept)    -0.7426811 0.04225771 -17.57504  3.826003e-69
age1-3 months  -1.9726274 0.09169641 -21.51259 1.186813e-102
age3-6 months  -2.1618582 0.08514807 -25.38940 3.302537e-142
age6-12 months -2.4878907 0.07554656 -32.93189 7.686765e-238
age1-2 years   -3.0043518 0.07267886 -41.33735  0.000000e+00
age2-5 years   -4.0859318 0.07564868 -54.01194  0.000000e+00
age5-10 years  -5.3552038 0.11411253 -46.92915  0.000000e+00

> deviance(pwe)
[1] 72.64013
</pre>
<p>
  The age model is equivalent to a piece-wise exponential survival model 
with no cohort effects. 
Compare the results with the gross effects in Table 7.3. 
Note the dramatic decrease in risk with age. 
At age one the risk of death is only 5% of what it is 
in the first month of life. 
</p>
<p>
  This model still doesn't fit the data, as evidenced by the
deviance or goodness of fit chi-squared. It is, however,
a remarkable improvement over the null, as indicated by the
reduction in deviance or the Wald test
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> deviance(em) - deviance(pwe)
[1] 4167.231

> wald(pwe,"age")
         [,1]
[1,] 4689.271
</pre>
<p>
You can see why demographers prefer age-specific mortality rates :)
</p>
<p>
<a name="ph"></a><h4>The Proportional Hazards Model</h4> 
</p>
<p>
  Now on to the additive model with main effects of age and cohort, 
which is equivalent to a proportional hazards model:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> ph <- glm(deaths ~ age + cohort + offset(os), family=poisson, data=co)

> summary(ph)$coefficients
                 Estimate Std. Error    z value      Pr(>|z|)
(Intercept)    -0.4484821 0.05453886  -8.223166  1.982007e-16

> deviance(ph)
[1] 6.182972

> pchisq(deviance(ph), ph$df.residual, lower.tail=FALSE)

> j <- grep("cohort",names(coef(ph)))

> exp(coef(ph)[j]) - 1 
cohort1960-67 cohort1968-76 
   -0.2769239    -0.3802004 
</pre>
<p>
Note that this model fits reasonably well, with a deviance
of 6.18 on 12 d.f., so the assumption of proportional hazards
is consistent with the data. 
</p>
<p>
Compare the results with the net effect estimates in Table 7.3,
and note that the anomaly with the youngest cohort has dissappeared.
The estimates now indicate a steady decline in mortality across 
cohorts. 
Taking the 1941-59 cohort as a baseline, mortality at every age from 
zero to ten was 28% lower for the 1960-67 cohort and 36% lower for 
the  more recent 1968-76 cohort. 
Can you explain why this trend did not emerge until we controlled 
for age? <i>Hint</i>: the survey was conducted in 1976. 
</p>
<p>
Here's a likelihood ratio test for the cohort effect adjusted for age. 
Note that we compare the age model with the additive 
model that has age and cohort. That is followed by the Wald test.
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> deviance(pwe) - deviance(ph)  
[1] 66.45716

> wald(ph,"cohort")
         [,1]
[1,] 68.59521
</pre>
<p>
The cohort differences within age groups are highly significant.
</p>
<p>
<a name="surv"></a><h4>Estimating Survival Probabilities</h4> 
</p>
<p>
Let us calculate the fitted life table shown in Table 7.4 of the 
lecture notes. 
The <code>predict</code> command following a Poisson regression has
and argument <code>type="response"</code> to calculate the expected 
number of events, which we then divide by exposure to obtain fitted 
rates. (An alternative is to leave out the <code>type</code>argument 
to obtain the linear predictor, substract the offset, and exponentiate 
to obtain the rate. I'll let you verify that you get the same prediction.)
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> co$hazard <- predict(ph, type="response")/co$exposure
</pre>
<p>
At this point recall that the age intervals have different widths. 
We just don't need the width for 10+. We then loop by cohort,
calculate the cumulative hazard by summing the product of the hazard
in each age by the width of the interval, and then exponentiate
the negative cumulative hazard to get the survival function:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> w <- w[-8]

> co$survival <- 0

> for(cohort in levels(co$cohort)) {
+   i <- which(co$cohort == cohort)
+   Hazard <- cumsum(co$hazard[i] * w)
+   co$survival[i] <- exp(-Hazard)
+ }
</pre>
<p>
Rather than list the data frame I will tabulate the survival
by age and cohort:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> S <- tapply(co$survival,list(co$age,co$cohort),function(x) round(x,4))

> S
            1941-59 1960-67 1968-76
0-1 months   0.9482  0.9623  0.9676
1-3 months   0.9342  0.9520  0.9587
3-6 months   0.9173  0.9395  0.9479
6-12 months  0.8933  0.9217  0.9325
1-2 years    0.8658  0.9010  0.9145
2-5 years    0.8391  0.8809  0.8970
5-10 years   0.8275  0.8721  0.8893
</pre>
<p>
Finally, here are the complements of the probability of surviving to age one
for each cohort. 
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> 1 - S["6-12 months",]  
1941-59 1960-67 1968-76 
 0.1067  0.0783  0.0675 
</pre>
<p>
These are known  as the infant mortality rates (although they are probabilities, 
not  rates) and are usually expressed per thousand births.
They declined from 106.7 to 78.3 to 67.5 across cohorts.
</p>
<h4>Other Methods</h4> 
<p>
R has functions for fitting some of the parametric models 
discussed in the bibliographic notes, such as the Weibull model. 
It also has non-parametric methods, including procedures for 
calculating Kaplan-Meier estimates and for fitting Cox regression 
models by partial likelihood. But that's a subject for another course.
</p>
<p>
Follow the link below for another example applying a piecewise exponential
survival model, this time to recidivism using individual rather than grouped data
and illustrating the creation of person-year files.

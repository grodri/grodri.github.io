<h2 class="first">2.7 Two-Way Analysis of Variance</h2>
<p>We start by reading the data and recreating setting in groups.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; library(dplyr)
&gt; fpe &lt;- read.table(&quot;https://grodri.github.io/datasets/effort.dat&quot;) |&gt;
+   mutate(setting_g = cut(setting, breaks=c(min(setting),70,80,max(setting)),
+   right=FALSE, include.lowest=TRUE, labels=c(&quot;Low&quot;,&quot;Medium&quot;,&quot;High&quot;))) </code></pre>
<p>Let us now create a copy of program effort and group it into
categories 0-4, 5-14 and 15+. We’ll call the variable
<code>effort_g</code> for effort in groups.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; fpe &lt;- mutate(fpe, effort_g = cut(effort, breaks=c(min(effort), 5, 15, max(effort)),
+   right=FALSE, include.lowest=TRUE, labels=c(&quot;Weak&quot;,&quot;Moderate&quot;,&quot;Strong&quot;)))</code></pre>
<p>Here’s a table showing steeper declines in countries with strong
programs, with a smaller difference between weak and moderate:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; group_by(fpe, effort_g) |&gt; summarize(change = mean(change))</code></pre>

2 Moderate   9.33
3 Strong    27.9 </code></pre>

<h3>An Additive Model</h3>

variables, with weak programs in low settings as the reference cell</p>

<p>Compare these estimates with the results in Table 2.15 and the anova
with Table 2.16 in the lecture notes.</p>
<p>Countries with strong family planning programs show steeper declines
than countries with weak programs at the same level of social setting,
on average 21 percentage points more.</p>
<p>This statement is based on the assumption of additivity, namely that
the difference in outcomes across categories of program effort is the
same at every level of setting. We will test this assumption <a
href="#id_2wayi">below</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see the differences in fertility change by level of
effort, among countries with the same level of setting are significant,
with an F-ratio of 11.5 on 2 and 15 d.f.</p>

<p>Let us reproduce Table 2.17 in the notes, showing fitted means by
grouped setting and effort. I will use <code>fitted()</code> to generate
fitted values, and then <code>summarize()</code> them by the two
relevant factors</p>

<div id="a-two-factor-interaction" class="section level3">
<h3>A Two-Factor Interaction</h3>
<p>Let us now consider a model with an interaction between social
setting and program effort, so differences in fertility decline by
effort will vary by setting.</p>
<p>In R we use a colon <code>:</code> to indicate an interaction term,
and an asterisk <code>*</code> to include main effects and interactions,
so <code>A*B</code> is equivalent to <code>A + B + A:B</code>.</p>

<p>Oops, our software dropped a term. Why? Because there are no
countries with strong programs in low settings, so we have only eight
groups, but are trying to represent their means using nine parameters,
which is obviously one too many. Fortunately this doesn’t affect
testing.</p>

<p>We have no evidence that the differences by effort vary with social
setting, with an F just below 1 on 3 and 12 d.f.</p>
<p>This makes the issue of interpreting parameters moot, but it may be
worth noting briefly the problems caused by the empty cell. As things
stand, the coefficient of moderate effort compares moderate with weak at
low setting, but the coefficient of strong effort compares strong with
weak at high setting. (Table 2.20 in the notes may help see this point.
When the term for high and strong is dropped, the only difference
between weak and strong programs at high setting is the coefficient of
strong.)</p>
<p>The parametrization I like best for this problem combines the main
effects of effort with the interactions, so we obtain differences
between strong and weak, and between moderate and weak programs, at each
level of setting. This allows us to omit the difference between strong
and weak programs at low setting, which is the one we can’t identify.
Try the specification below</p>
<pre><code>lm( change ~ setting_g + effort_g:setting_g, data=fpe)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="dummy-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Dummy Variables</h3>
<p>You could have obtained the same results in this unit using dummy
variables. For the record, this is how you might build the dummies and
fit the models. For the additive model we need just four indicators, two
for each factor. In R I make sure the dummies are numeric, not boolean,
otherwise the coefficient would have names like
<code>effortStrongTRUE</code>.</p>
<pre><code>d &lt;- as.numeric # for short
mutate(fpe, 
  settingMed = d(setting_g==&quot;Medium&quot;), settingHigh = d(setting_g==&quot;High&quot;),
  effortMod = d(effort_g==&quot;Moderate&quot;), effortStrong = d(effort_g==&quot;Strong&quot;))
lm(change ~ settingMed + settingHigh + effortMod + effortStrong, data=fpe)</code></pre>
<p>We need a total of four dummies to represent the interactions, which
can be computed simply as the product of the indicators for the main
effects.</p>
<pre><code>fpe &lt;- mutate(fpe, 
  seMedMod = settingMed*effortMod, seMedStrong=settingMed*effortStrong,
  seHighMod = settingHigh*effortMod, seHighStrong = settingHigh*effortStrong)
lm(change settingMed + settingHigh + effortMod + effortStrong + 
  seMedMod + seMedStrong + seHighMod + seHighStrong, data = fpe)</code></pre>
<p>Our software will again omit a variable, but you have more control on
what to drop. Can you figure out which dummies you would need to show
the effects of effort at each level of setting?</p>

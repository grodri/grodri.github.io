<h3>2.7 Two-Way Analysis of Variance</h3>
<p>
We now fit a model treating both social setting and family
planning effort as factors. We start by grouping effort into
the three categories defined above:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> effort.g <- cut(effort, 
+   breaks=c(min(effort),5,15,max(effort)), 
+   right=FALSE, include.lowest=TRUE, 
+   labels=c("Weak","Moderate","Strong"))
</pre>
<p>
Next we fit an additive model and summarize the results:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> m2g <- lm(change ~ setting.g + effort.g)
> summary(m2g)
Call:
lm(formula = change ~ setting.g + effort.g)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max

Residual standard error: 6.188 on 15 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.7833,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.7255 
F-statistic: 13.55 on 4 and 15 DF,  p-value: 7.19e-05
</pre>
<p>
Compare these estimates with the results in Table 2.15.
Countries with strong family planning programs show steeper declines 
than countries with weak programs at the same level of social setting, 
on average 21 percentage points more.
</p>
<p>
This statement is based on the assumption of additivity, namely that the 
difference in outcomes across categories of program effort is the same 
at every level of setting. We will test this assumption later.
</p>
<p>
Calling the <code>anova()</code> function produces the
hierarchical analysis of variance in Table 2.16 of the notes:

<p>
As you can see the differences by level of effort among countries
with the same level of setting are significant, with an F-ratio of
11.5 on 2 and 15 d.f.
</p>
<h4>Fitted Values</h4>
<p>
Let us reproduce Table 2.17 in the notes, showing fitted means by
categories of setting and effort. I use <code>fitted()</code> to
extract the fitted values and <code>tapply()</code> to produce a
table of means. 
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> fv <- fitted(m2g)
> tfv <- tapply(fv,list(setting.g, effort.g),mean)
> tfv
           Weak  Moderate   Strong
Low    5.379275  9.215544       NA
Medium 3.698446  7.534715 24.36995
High   7.766839 11.603109 28.43834
</pre>
<p>
The NA value on the top right cell is due to the fact that there
are no countries with strong effort in low settings. However, we
can still make a prediction for that cell:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> tfv[1,3] <- coef(m2g) %*% c(1,0,0,0,1)
> tfv
           Weak  Moderate   Strong
Low    5.379275  9.215544 26.05078
Medium 3.698446  7.534715 24.36995
High   7.766839 11.603109 28.43834
</pre>
<p>
we use <code>coef()</code> to extract the coefficients and we
multiply them by a vector representing the cell of interest.
Because the model is additive the difference between any two
columns is the same for every row. 
</p>
<p>
We can use the complete table to produce adjusted means by 
effort when the distribution of setting is set to the marginal 
totals of 7,5 and 8, reproducing the last row of Table 2.17.
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> data.frame(adj=t(tfv) %*% c(7,5,8)/20) 
               adj
Weak      5.914093
Moderate  9.750363
Strong   26.585596
</pre>
<p>
The same technique can be used to produce expected declines
by setting adjusted for effort (the last column of Table 2.17).
This is a form of model-based standardization.
</p>
<h4>A Two-Factor Interaction</h4>
<p>
Let us now consider a model with an interaction between social setting 
and program effort, so differences in fertility decline by effort will 
vary by setting. In a model formula we can include the interaction
between two factor using the colon operator. We can also use a
star (or asterisk) to include the main effects and interactions.
Thus, for factor A and B, the model A*B is exactly the same as 
A + B + A:B.

With 3 categories of effort and 3 for setting one would have expected
nine parameters, but we only obtain 8 because, as noted earlier, we
have an empty cell. R automatically drops one of the interaction
terms. Fortunately this doesn't affect testing. We can obtain a
join test of significance for the 3 parameters representing the
interaction using anova:

<p>
The F-statistic for the interaction term is 0.99 on 3 and 12 d.f.,
which is clearly not significant. We have no evidence that the 
differences by effort vary according to social setting.
</p>
<p>
This makes the issue of interpreting parameters moot, but it may be 
worth noting briefly the problems caused by the empty cell. As things 
stand, the coefficient of moderate effort compares moderate with weak 
at low setting, but the coefficient of strong effort compares strong 
with weak at high setting. (Table 2.20 in the notes may help see this 
point. When the term for high and strong is dropped, the only difference 
between weak and strong programs at high setting is the coefficient of strong.)
</p>
<p>
The parametrization I like best for this problem combines the main effects 
of effort with the interactions, so we obtain differences between strong 
and weak, and between moderate and weak programs, at each level of setting. 
This allows us to omit the difference between strong and weak programs at 
low setting, which is the one we can't identify. I will not pursue this 
tack at this point, but will return to the idea when we have to interpret 
a significant interaction. If you are curious try the model formula
<code>change ~ setting.g + effort.g:setting.g</code>, which achieves 
the desired result by including the interaction but omitting the main
effect of effort.

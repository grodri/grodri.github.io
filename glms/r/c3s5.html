<h3>3.5 Models with Two Predictors</h3>
<p>
We now turn to logistic regression models with two or more predictors.
Following the notes, we will use illustrate the procedures using the tabulation 
of contraceptive use by age (in groups) and desire for more children, shown
in Table 3.17 in the notes. (This is the last table we type :)
</p>
<pre class='r'>

<h4>The Deviance Table</h4>
<p>
There are five basic models of interest for this dataset. I will fit them all
to reproduce the deviances in Table 3.8, and then consider the models one by one. 
As usual, we start by creating the matrix of users and non-users.
The we fit the models and store the resulting objects in a list.
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> cuse$Y <- cbind(cuse$using, cuse$notUsing)

> models <- list(
+   null     = glm(Y ~ 1, family=binomial, data=cuse),
+   age      = glm(Y ~ age, family=binomial, data=cuse),
+   desire   = glm(Y ~ nomore, family=binomial, data=cuse),
+   additive = glm(Y ~ age + nomore, family=binomial, data=cuse),
+   interact = glm(Y ~ age * nomore, family=binomial, data=cuse)
+ )
</pre>
<p>
Producing the table is now easy:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> data.frame( 
+     deviance = round(unlist(lapply(models,deviance)),2),
+     df       = unlist(lapply(models,df.residual))
+ )
         deviance df
null       145.67  7
age         66.48  4
desire      54.00  6
additive    16.79  3
interact     0.00  0
</pre>
<p>
The workhorse here is <code>lapply</code>, which applies a function over a
list or vector. Here the extractors <code>deviance</code> and 
<code>df.residuals</code> are called with each model. I then use
<code>unlist()</code> to simplify the output and <code>round()</code>
to print the deviances in a friendlier format.
</p>
<h4>The Age Model</h4>
<p>
Here is the model treating age as a factor with four levels:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> summary(models$age)

glm(formula = Y ~ age, family = binomial, data = cuse)

</pre>
<p>
Note that the parameter estimates and standard errors are exactly the
same as in Section 3.4 when we worked with only four binomial observations.
This shows that grouping the data does not affect any of these statistics.
</p>
<p>
The model deviance, however, is different. In Section 3.4 the deviance was
zero because the age model fitted exactly the four groups. Here the
deviance is 66.48 because we are working with eight groups, indicating
that the model with age as the only predictor doesn't fit the data
by age and desire for more children.
</p>
<p>
You may want to verify that the model with "nomore" as the only predictor
produces the same estimates and standard errors as in Section 3.3.
</p>
<h4>The Additive Model</h4>
<p>
We are now ready to consider a model with both age and desire for no more children:

> b <- coef(models$additive) 

> exp(b["nomore"])
 nomore 
2.27981 
</pre>
<p>
Compare the results with table 3.9 on page 26 of the notes.
Exponentiating the coefficient of "nomore" we get an odds ratio of 2.28. 
This means that the odds of using contraception among women who want no more children 
are double the odds among women in the same age group who do want more children. 
The model assumes that the odds ratio by "nomore" is the same for every age group, 
an assumption we will need to test.
</p>
<p>
To test the significance of the odds ratio we can use the Wald test given in the 
output, a z-statistic of 7.04 (which can be squared to obtain a chi-squared statistic 
on one d.f.) The likelihood ratio test would compare the additive model with the 
age model. Here are the two tests:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> V <- vcov(models$additive)

> b["nomore"]^2/V["nomore","nomore"]
  nomore 
49.51564 

> deviance(models$age) - deviance(models$additive)
[1] 49.69282
</pre>
<p>
Note the convenience of using character subscripts to extract the coefficient and
variance for "nomore".
We obtain chi-squared statistics of 49.5 and 49.7 on one d.f., so there is no doubt 
that the odds of using contraception in any given age group vary by whether the 
women want more children.
</p>
<h4>A Model With an Interaction</h4>
<p>
We now move to the model with an interaction, so that the effect of having no
more children on the logit of the probability of using contraception is allowed 
to vary from one age group to another.

</pre>
<p>
The estimates show a difference by desire for more children of 0.06 in the logit scale
for women under age 25, with additional differences of 0.27 for women 25-29, 1.09 for
women in their thirties and 1.38 for women in their forties. Clearly the difference is
larger the older the age group. (You may want to be careful about saying "increases with
age" as this is a cross-section, but maybe that is clear enough from the context.)
</p>
<p>
We can test the significance of the interaction term using a Wald test or computing
a likelihood ratio test that compares the models with an without the interaction:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> b <- coef(models$interact)

> V <- vcov(models$interact)

> i <- 6:8

> t(b[i]) %*% solve(V[i,i]) %*% b[i]
         [,1]
[1,] 16.02916

> deviance(models$additive) - deviance(models$interact)
[1] 16.78881
</pre>
<p>
Here I used the fact that the coefficients representing the iteraction terms are
in positions 5, 6 and 7.  We get a Wald statistic of 16.03 on 3 d.f. and a
likelihoor ratio test of 16.79 on the same 3 d.f. Clearly the interaction is
significant, so the ratio of the odds of using contraception among women who
do and do not want another child varies by age.
</p>
<p>
This is not the same as testing for the effect of preferences for more children. 
A test for the "main" effect of nomore would just test for women under age 25 
and would find no difference. To test at all ages together we can compare this 
model with the age model, or do a Wald test for all terms involving preferences
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> i <- 5:8

> t(b[i]) %*% solve(V[i,i]) %*% b[i]
         [,1]
[1,] 62.44789

> deviance(models$age) - deviance(models$interact)
[1] 66.48163
</pre>
<p>
We get highly-significant chi-squared values of 62.45 and 66.48.
</p>
<h4>Reparametrizing Interactions</H4>
<p>
In may be easier to present the results in terms of odds ratios by desire for 
more children  in each of the age groups, as discussed on page 27 of the notes, 
see also Table 3.10.
(In fact I strongly recommend this approach, because models with interactions are
often misinterpreted; people forget that the so-called "main effect" is just the 
effect for the reference cell, and the "interactions" are additional effects. It is 
much better to do this calculations ourselves, and present the results in a 
more-easily understood and robust way.)
</p>
<p>
To do this we simply specify the model as in terms of the main effect of age
and the interaction, as <code>age + nomore:age</code> instead of the product
<code>age * nomore</code>, which expands to <code>age + nomore + age:nomore</code>.
R will still fit a model with 8 parameters. But it will use one for the constant,
three for the age groups, and four for the effects of nomore at each age. The
conventional approach uses one for the constant, three for the age groups (for
women who want more), one for nomore (for women in the first age group), and three
"additional" effects for the other combinations of age and no more (such as nomore
in the other three age groups).

Because the model is saturated, it is easy to verify that these estimates are
the differences in logits between women who want no more children and those who want 
more in each age group. To obtain the corresponding odds-ratios we simply exponentiate:

<pre class='r'>
> b <- coef(alt)

> i <- 5:8

 age< 25:nomore age25-29:nomore age30-39:nomore age40-49:nomore

</pre>
<p>
we find that the odds of using contraception for women who want no more children,
compared to those who do, are 7% higher at ages under 25, 39% higher at ages 25-29, 
three times as high at age 30-39, and four times as high at age 40-49.  
This leads to a more direct presentation of the results.

We see that the odds of using contraception are 128% higher among women who want
no more children than among women who want more and have the same age. The estimated
difference in log-odds when we adjust linearly for age is very similar to that 
obtained by treating age as a factor (0.826 vs. 0.824).

The estimates agree with the results in Table 3.12. We see that the odds of using
contraception among women who want more children are about two percent higher per 
year of age. The odds among women who want no more children are double those of 
women who want more at the mean age (30.6). This ratio is about five percent higher 
per year of age above the mean (and of course five percent lower per year below 
the mean).
</p>
<p>
Another way to look at this result is to note that the odds of using contraception 
among women who want no more children are about 7 percent higher per year of age. 
This may be seen more clearly if we parametrize the model using two constants and 
two slopes, as done in Table 3.12:

To obtain this result I included dummies for both more and nomore (leaving out the
constants) and constructed terms that represent age separately for more and nomore.

Time for a plot. We will reproduce Figure 3.3 in the notes, comparing the analysis 
of covariance model we just fitted, a model with a quadratic effect of age where the
curvature is assumed to be the same for the two groups defined by preferences, and 
the anova type model which was saturated for the age by preferences table and thus
represents observed logits.

Visually the model with some curvature provides a much better fit than the
model that assumes linearity of age effects with different slopes by desire for
more children.  While the simpler model passes the goodness of fit test, the
fact that we can reduce the deviance by 6.79 at the expece of just one d.f.
indicates significant curvature.

For purposes of presentation you may consider doing an equivalent plot in the probability
scale. Don't forget that a linear relationship in the logit scale will be nonlinear in
the probability scale, so you should probably a fine age grid to reflect the curvature.

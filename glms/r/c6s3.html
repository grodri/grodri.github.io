<h3>6.3 The Conditional Logit Model</h3>
<p>
R can also fit the more general McFadden conditional logit model 
discussed in the notes, a random-utility model where the expected
utility of a choice may depend on characteristics of the alternatives,
characteristics of the choices, and variables that are specific to
a combination of person and alternative, for example distance to a
hospital.  The special case where all predictors are individual
characteristics is the multinomial model of the previous section.
</p>
<p>
If you are interested in this type of model I recommend that you
download the packages <code>mlogit</code> and/or <code>mnlogit</code>
and study their documentation. The more general model is beyond the
scope of the course.

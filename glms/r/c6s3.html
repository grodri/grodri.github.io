<h2 class="first">6.3 The Conditional Logit Model</h2>
<p>Stata and R are also able to fit the more general McFadden
conditional logit model discussed in the notes, a random-utility model
where the expected utility of a choice may depend on characteristics of
the alternatives, characteristics of the people making the choices, and
variables which are specific to a combination of person and alternative,
for example distance to a cinema. The special case where all predictors
are individual characteristics is the multinomial logit model of the
previous section.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this type of model I recommend that you
download the packages <code>mlogit</code> and/or <code>mnlogit</code>
and study their documentation. The more general model is beyond the
scope of the course.</p>

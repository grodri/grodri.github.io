<h1 class="first">6. Multinomial Response Models</h1>
<p>This section deals with regression models for discrete data with more
than two response categories, where the assumption of a multinomial
distribution is appropriate. We will consider multinomial logits for
nominal data, and ordered logit models for ordinal data, with a brief
mention of alternative-specific conditional logit models. We will also
consider sequential logit models. (In line with the current syllabus we
are skipping log-linear models for contingency tables, and thus their
relationship with multinomial logit models.)</p>

<h2>6.1 The Nature of Multinomial Data</h2>
<p>We start by reading the data on contraceptive choice by age for
currently married women in El Salvador, 1985, found in Table 6.1 of the
lecture notes. The data are in “long” format with one row for each
combination of predictor and response, showing the age group, method
choice, and number of cases. In R we reshape the data so each method
choice is a column, a layout that works better with the functions we
will use.</p>

<p>With only one predictor, this example affords limited opportunities
for interpreting coefficients, but will allow us to focus on the outcome
and the comparisons underlying each type of model.</p>

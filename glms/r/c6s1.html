<h2>6. Multinomial Response Models</h2>
<p>
This section deals with regression models for discrete data with more 
than two response categories, where the assumption of a multinomial 
distribution is appropriate. We will consider three kinds of models:
multinomial logits, sequential logits, and ordered logits.

<h3>6.1 The Nature of Multinomial Data</h3>
<p>
We start by typing in the data on contraceptive choice by age, found in 
Table 6.1 of the lecture notes. I will enter the data as 7 multinomial
observations with the counts sterilized, using other methods and using
no method in each age group:

<pre class='r'>
> cuse <- data.frame(matrix(c(
+    1,   3,  61, 232,
+    2,  80, 137, 400,
+    3, 216, 131, 301,
+    4, 268,  76, 203,
+    5, 197,  50, 188,
+    6, 150,  24, 164,
+    7,  91,  10, 183), 7, 4, byrow=TRUE))

> names(cuse) <- c("a","ster","other","none")

> ages <- paste(seq(15,45,5),seq(19,49,5),sep="-")

> cuse$ageg <- ages[cuse$a]

> cuse
  a ster other none  ageg
1 1    3    61  232 15-19
2 2   80   137  400 20-24
3 3  216   131  301 25-29
4 4  268    76  203 30-34
5 5  197    50  188 35-39
6 6  150    24  164 40-44
7 7   91    10  183 45-49
</pre>
<p>
With only one predictor this example affords limited opportunities for 
interpreting coefficients, but will allow us to focus on the outcome and 
the comparisons underlying each type of model.

<h3>6.5 Ordered Logit Models</h3>
<p>
We now turn our attention to models for ordered categorical outcomes. 
Obviously the multinomial and sequential logit models can be applied 
as well, but they make no explicit use of the fact that the categories 
are ordered. The models considered here are specifically designed for 
ordered data.
</p>
<p>
These models can be fitted in R using the <code>polr</code> function,
short for <i>proportional odds logistic regression</i>, in the package 
<code>MASS</code>. The function follows the usual model formula 
conventions.
</p>
<h4>Housing Conditions in Copenhagen</h4>
<p>
We will use data from 1681 residents of twelve areas in Copenhagen, 
classified in terms of the type of housing they have (tower blocks, 
apartments, atrium houses and terraced houses), their feeling of 
influence on apartment management (low, medium, high), their degree 
of contact with the neighbors (low, high), and their satisfaction 
with housing conditions (low, medium, high).
</p>
<p>
The data are available in the datasets page and can be read directly 
from there using <code>read.table</code>:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> copen <- read.table("http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/copen.dat")

> copen[1:6,]
  housing influence contact satisfaction  n
1   tower       low     low          low 21
2   tower       low     low       medium 21
3   tower       low     low         high 28
4   tower       low    high          low 14
5   tower       low    high       medium 19
6   tower       low    high         high 37
</pre>
<p>
We will treat satisfaction as the outcome and type of housing, feeling of
influence and contact with the neighbors as categorical predictors.
The data are grouped as in the earlier example, but the layout is long 
rather than wide. It corresponds to the way one would enter individual data,
with an additional colum <code>n</code> showing the number of observations
in each group.
</p>
<p>
It will be useful for comparison purposes to calculate the log-likelihood
for the saturated multinomial logit model, where each of the 24 combinations 
of housing type, influence and contact, has its own distribution. 
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> copen$g <- rep(1:24,rep(3,24))

> msat <- multinom(satisfaction ~ as.factor(g), weights=n, data=copen)
# weights:  75 (48 variable)
initial  value 1846.767257 
iter  10 value 1723.705246
iter  20 value 1716.225889
iter  30 value 1715.715730
final  value 1715.710848 
converged

> logLik(msat)
'log Lik.' -1715.711 (df=48)
</pre>
<p>
The log-likelihood is -1715.7. You can verify that this is 
<code>sum(n*log(p))</code> where n are the counts and p the proportions
in each category of satisfaction within each of the 24 groups.
</p>
<h4>The Proportional Odds Model</h4>
<p>
The next task is to fit the additive ordered logit model from Table 6.5 
in the notes. I will relevel the predictors so the reference cell are
tower residents with low influence and low contact, and will make sure
the outcome categories are ordered from low to high.

'log Lik.' -1739.575 (df=8)

> 2*(logLik(msat) - logLik(madd))
'log Lik.' 47.7276 (df=48)
</pre>
<p>
The log-likelihood is -1739.6, so the deviance for this model compared to 
the saturated multinomial model is 47.7 on 40 d.f.  This deviance is
not much more than one would expect when saving 40 parameters, so we have
no evidence against the additive model.  To be thorough, however, we will
explore a few interactions just in case the deviance is concentrated on 
a few d.f. 
</p>
<p>
We could also compare the model with a saturated ordered logit model,
which is easily done here by treating <code>g</code> as a factor. That
would give a chi-squared test of 32.69 on 17 d.f. This test focuses on
posible interactions within the single equation model. The comparison
against the multi-equation model is a bit more stringent.
</p>
<h4>Models With Interactions</h4>
<p>
The next step is to explore two-factor interactions. 
I will compare each model against the additive to focus on the improvement,
but I could also compare with the saturated multinomial to check fit.
In either case we can use <code>update</code> to simplify the fitting
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> deviance(madd) - deviance(update(madd, . ~ . + housing:influence))
[1] 22.50935

> deviance(madd) - deviance(update(madd, . ~ . + housing:contact))
[1] 8.666155

> deviance(madd) - deviance(update(madd, . ~ . + influence:contact))
[1] 0.2089536
</pre>
<p>
The interaction between housing and influence reduces the deviance by 25.22
at the expense of only six d.f., so it is worth a second look. The interaction
between housing and contact makes a much smaller dent of 8.67, and the 
interaction between influence and contact adds practically nothing.
</p>
<p>
Clearly the interaction to add is the first one, allowing the association
between satisfaction with housing and a feeling of influence on management net
of contact with neighbors to depend on the type of housing. 
To examine parameter estimates we refit the model

Residual Deviance: 3456.64

> deviance(mint)-deviance(msat)
[1] 25.21826
</pre>
<p>
The model deviance of 25.2 on 34 d.f. is not significant, so the model fits.
To test for theinteraction effect we compared this model with the additive,
obtaining a chi-squared statistic of 22.5 on six d.f., which is significant 
at the 0.001 level.
</p>
<p>
At this point one might consider adding a second interaction. The obvious choice
is to allow the association between satisfaction and contact with neighbors to
depend on the type of housing. This would reduce the deviance by 7.95 at the
expense of three d.f., a gain that just makes the conventional 5% cutoff with a
p-value of 0.047. In the interest of simplicity we will not pursue this addition
</p>
<p>
The estimates indicate that respondents who have high contact with their
neighbors are more satisfied than respondents with low contact who live in the
same type of housing and have the same feeling of influence on management. The
difference is estimated as 0.372 units in the underlying logistic scale.
Dividing by the standard deviation of the (standard) logistic distribution we
obtain
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> b <- coef(mint)

> b["contacthigh"]/(pi/sqrt(3))
contacthigh 
  0.2051395 
</pre>
<p>
So the difference in satisfaction between high and low contact with neighbors among respondents with the same housing and influence is 0.205 standard deviations.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, we can exponentiate the coefficient:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> exp(b["contacthigh"])
contacthigh 
   1.450752 
</pre>
<p>
The odds of reporting high satisfaction (relative to medium or low), are 45%
higher among respondents who have high contact with the neighbors than among
tenants with low contact in the same type of housing and influence. The odds of
reporting medium or high satisfaction (as opposed to low) are also 45% higher in
this group.
</p>
<p>
Interpretation of the effects of housing type and influence requires taking into
account the interaction effect. In the notes we describe differences by housing
type among those who feel they have little influence in management, and the
effects of influence in each type of housing. Let us do something a bit
different here, and focus on the joint effects of housing and influence,
combining the main effects and interactions. The easiest way to do this is
to refit the model omitting the main effects, which causes R to fold them into
the interaction. We then plot them:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> mint2 <- polr(satisfaction ~ contact + housing:influence, weights=n, data=copen)

> HI <- matrix(c(coef(mint2)[-1],0), 4, 3)

> HI <- (HI - HI[1,1])/(pi/sqrt(3)) # make 1,1 the reference, express as sd

> rownames(HI) <- levels(copen$housing)

> colnames(HI) <- levels(copen$influence)

> trio <- c("#ddeeff","#80aae6", "#3366cc")

> png("fig63.png", width=500, height=400)

> barplot(t(HI), beside=TRUE, col=trio, border=NA)

> legend("bottomleft", fill=trio, legend=levels(copen$influence), bty="n")

> dev.off()
RStudioGD 
        2 
</pre>

<img src="fig63.png"  class="img-responsive center-block" />

<p>
Satisfaction with housing conditions is highest for 
residents of tower blocks who feel they have high influence,
and lowest for residents of terraced houses with low influence.
Satisfaction increases with influence in each type of housing,
but the difference is largest for terraced houses and apartments
than atrium houses and towers. 
</p>
<p>
Another way to present the results is by focusing on the effects of 
influence within each type of housing or, alternatively, on the
effects of housing type within each category of influence. 
All we need to do is substract the first row (or the first colum)
from our predicted values:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> quartet <- c("#ddeeff", "#9dc1ee","#6593dd", "#3366cc")

> png("fig64.png", width=750, height=300)

> par(mfrow=c(1,2))

> barplot(apply(HI,1,function(x)x-x[1]), beside=TRUE, col=trio, border=NA)

> legend("toplef", fill=trio, legend=levels(copen$influence), bty="n")

> barplot(apply(HI,2,function(x)x-x[1]), beside=TRUE, col=quartet, border=NA)

> legend("bottomright", fill=quartet, legend=levels(copen$housing), bty="n")

> dev.off()
RStudioGD 
        2 
</pre>

<img src="fig64.png" class="img-responsive center-block"/>

<p>
On the left panel we see more clearly the differences by influence in each
type of housing. As noted above having influence is good, particularly of
you live in a terraced house or apartments.
The right panel shows differences by type of housing within categories of
influence. Tower residents are generally speaking more satisfied than
residents of other types of housing, and the differences tend to be larger
when influence is low.
</p>
<h4>Estimation of Probabilities</h4>
<p>
Let us consider predicted probabilities. 
The  function <code>predict</code> for objects of class <code>polr</code>
has a <code>type</code> argument than can be "class" to predict the outcome
or "probs" to compute predicted probabilities. Let us do the latter:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> copen$probs <- predict(mint, type="probs")
</pre>
<p>
We'll look at these results for tower block dwellers, 
with little influence and with high and low contact with neighbors. 
The first of these groups is, of course, the reference cell. 
I add the conditions satisfaction=="low" to list the probabilities 
just once for each group:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> towerlow <- subset(copen, 
+   housing=="tower" & influence =="low" & satisfaction=="low")

> towerlow[,c("contact","probs")]
  contact probs.low probs.medium probs.high
1     low 0.2914869    0.2860400  0.4224731
4    high 0.2209299    0.2642112  0.5148588
</pre>
<p>
We see that among tower tenants with low influence, those with high contact with
their neighbors have a higher probability of high satisfaction and a lower
probability of medium or low satisfaction, than those with low contact with the
neighbors.
</p>
<p>
It is instructive to reproduce these calculations 'by hand'. For the reference
cell all we need are the cutpoints. Remember that the model predicts cumulative
probabilities, which is why we difference the results. We write a one-liner
to facilitate converting cumulative logits to probabilities. The cutpoints
or intercepts are stored in a slot named <code>zeta</code>
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> l2p <- function(eta, cdf=plogis) {P <- cdf(eta); c(P[1],P[2]-P[1],1-P[2]); }

> l2p(mint$zeta)
 low|medium medium|high medium|high 
  0.2914869   0.2860400   0.4224731 
</pre>
<p>
For the group with high contact we need to subtract the corresponding coefficient
from the cutpoints. The change of sign is needed to convert coefficients from the
latent variable to the cumulative probability formulations (or from upper to lower
tails).
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> l2p(mint$zeta - coef(mint)["contacthigh"])
 low|medium medium|high medium|high 
  0.2209299   0.2642112   0.5148588 
</pre>
<p>
The results agree exactly with the output from <code>predict</code>
</p>
<h4>The Ordered Probit Model</h4>
<p>
We now consider ordered probit models, starting with the additive model in 
Table 6.6:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> mpadd <- polr(satisfaction ~ housing + contact + influence, 
+   weights=n, data=copen, method="probit")

polr(formula = satisfaction ~ housing + contact + influence, 
    data = copen, weights = n, method = "probit")

> logLik(mpadd)
'log Lik.' -1739.844 (df=8)

> deviance(mpadd) - deviance(msat)
[1] 48.26715
</pre>
<p>
The model has a log-likelihood of -1739.8, a little bit below that of the additive
ordered logit. This is also reflected in the slightly higher deviance.
</p>
<p>
Next we add the housing by influence interaction
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> mpint <- polr(update(mpadd, . ~ . + housing:influence), method="probit")

> summary(mpint)

polr(formula = update(mpadd, . ~ . + housing:influence), method = "probit")

> logLik(mpint)
'log Lik.' -1728.665 (df=14)

> deviance(mpint) - deviance(msat)
[1] 25.90907
</pre>
<p>
We now have a log-likelihood of -1728.7 and a deviance of 25.9. which is almost
indistinguishable from the corresponding ordered logit model.
</p>
<p>
The estimates indicate that tenants with high contact with the neighbors are 0.228
standard deviations higher in the latent satisfaction scale than tenants with low
contact, who live in the same type of housing and have the same feeling of
influence in management. Recall that the comparable logit estimate was 0.205.
</p>
<p>
The probabilities for the two groups compared earlier can be computed using the <code>predict</code> function, or more instructively 'by hand', using exactly the same code as before but with the normal 

instead of the logistic c.d.f. 
(Now you see why our one-liner had a cdf argument.)
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> rbind(l2p(mpint$zeta, cdf=pnorm),

[1,]  0.2932275   0.2817922   0.4249803
[2,]  0.2199278   0.2644026   0.5156696
</pre>
<p>
The main thing to note here is that the results are very close to the 
corresponding predictions based on the ordered logit model.
</p>
<h4>The Proportional Hazards Model</h4>
<p>
The third model mentioned in the lecture notes uses a complementary log-log link
and has a proportional hazards interpretation. This model can be fit ny
specifying <code>method="cloglog"</code>.  We will consider this link when
we discuss proportional hazards models in the next chapter.
</p>
<p>
Just for fun, here's how to combine main effects and interactions
using the results from the original fit, without the need for another fit.
The code relies on the order of the coefficients in the model formula: 
housing(1:3), influence(4:5), contact(6) and then the interaction(7:12):
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> h <- c(0, coef(mint)[1:3])  # "main" effects of housing

> i <- c(0, coef(mint)[4:5])  # "main" effects of influence

> h.i <- matrix(coef(mint)[7:12],3,2) # interaction terms

> hi <- outer(h,i,"+")                # add the main effects ...

> hi[-1,-1] <- hi[-1,-1] + h.i        # ... plus the interaction
</pre>
<p>
You may verify that <code>hi</code> is exactly the same as <code>HI</code>.
</p>

<h2 class="first">6.2 The Multinomial Logit Model</h2>
<p>Make sure you read the data as shown in <a href="c6s1">Section
6.1</a>.</p>

<p>We start with multinomial logit models treating age as a predictor
and contraceptive use as the outcome. R has several functions that can
fit multinomial logit models. We will emphasize the classic
<code>multinom</code> in Venables and Ripley’s <code>nnet</code> package
because it is simple, does everything we need, and is already included
in your R installation. Alternatives include <code>mlogit</code> and
<code>mnlogit</code>; these fit a wider variety of models, but are a bit
harder to use.</p>
<div id="age-as-a-factor" class="section level3">
<h3>Age as a Factor</h3>
<p>Obviously the model that treats age as a factor with 7 levels is
saturated for this data. We can easily obtain the log-likelihood, and
predicted values if we needed them. <span class="r">By default
<code>multinom</code> picks the first response category as the
reference. We take care of that by putting “no method”
first.`</span>’</p>

<h3>Linear and Quadratic Effects</h3>
<p>Following the notes, we will consider a model with linear and
quadratic effects of age. To this end we define the midpoints of age and
its square. For consistency with the notes we will not center age before
computing the square, although I generally recommend that.</p>

<p>Compare the parameter estimates with Table 6.2 in the notes. As usual
with quadratics, it is easier to plot the results, which we do below.
The log-odds of using sterilization rather than no method increase
rapidly with age to reach a maximum at 36.5. The log-odds of using a
method other than sterilization rather than no method, increase slightly
to reach a maximum at age 27.8 and then decline. (The turning points
were calculated by setting the derivatives to zero.)</p>

<p>The model chi-squared, which as usual compares the current and null
models, indicates that the hypothesis of no age differences in
contraceptive choise is soundly rejected with a chi-squared of 500.6 on
4 d.f. To see where the d.f. come from, note that the current model has
six parameters (two quadratics with three parameters each) and the null
model of course has only two (the two constants).</p>
<p>To test the goodness of fit of the model we compare it with the model
that treats age as a factor, which is saturated for these data. The
“deviances” reported by <code>multinom</code>’ for these models are
5766.273 and 5745.798. They are calculated as <em>-2logL</em>, where
<em>logL</em> is the individual data log-likelihood. This is why the
“deviance” for the saturated model is not zero. But we can compute
differences among deviances, which are correct.</p>

<p>The graph suggests that most of the lack of fit comes from
overestimation of the relative odds of being sterilized compared to
using no method at ages 15-19. Adding a dummy for this age group
confirms the result:</p>

<p>The deviance is now only 12.10 on 6 d.f., so we pass the goodness of
fit test. (We really didn’t need the dummy in the equation for other
methods, so the gain comes from just one d.f.)</p>
<p>An important caveat with multinomial logit models is that we are
modeling odds or <em>relative</em> probabilities, and it is always
possible for the odds of one category to increase while the probability
of that category declines, simply because the odds of another category
increase more. To examine this possibility one can always compute
predicted probabilities.</p>
<p>We pursue these issues at greater length in a discussion of the
interpretation of multinomial logit coefficients, including the
calculation of continuous and discrete marginal effects, in <a
href="mlogit">an analysis available here</a>.</p>

<h3>6.2 The Multinomial Logit Model</h3>
<p>
We start with multinomial logit models treating age as a predictor and 
contraceptive use as the outcome. 
</p>
<p>
R has several functions that can fit multinomial logit models. We will
emphasize the classic <code>multinom</code> in Venables and Ripley's
<code>nnet</code> package because it is simple, does everything we need,
and is already included in your R installation. 
Alternatives include <code>mlogit</code> and <code>mnlogit</code>, 
which fit a wider variety of models but are a bit harder to use.
</p>
<p>
The <code>multinom</code> function accepts a model formula where the
outcome is a vector with a factor representing the response categories,
or a matrix with the counts in the various categories, which is the
case for us. 
This is a direct generalization of the way logit models work in R.
</p>
<h4>Age as a Factor</h4>
<p>
Obviously the model that treats age as a factor with 7 levels is 
saturated for this data. We can easily obtain the log-likelihood, 
and predicted values if we needed them. 
By default <code>multinom</code> picks the first response category as
the reference. We take care of that by putting "no method" first

You could use <code>summary(msat)</code> to obtain standard errors 
as well, but we won't bother.
</p>
<h4>Linear and Quadratic Effects</h4>
<p>
Following the notes we will consider a model with linear and quadratic
effects of age. For consistency with the notes we will not center age 
before computing the square, although I generally recommend that.

<p>
Compare the parameter estimates with Table 6.2 in the notes. As usual 
with quadratics it is easier to plot the results, which we do below. 
The log-odds of using sterilization rather than no method increase 
rapidly with age to reach a maximum at 36.5. The log-odds of using a 
method other than sterilization rather than no method increase slightly 
to reach a maximum at age 28.5 and then decline. (The turning points 
were calculated above by setting the derivatives to zero.)
</p>
<p>
The model chi-square, which as usual compares the current and null models, can be obtained by fitting the null model:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> deviance(multinom(Y~1, data=cuse)) - deviance(mlq)
# weights:  6 (2 variable)
initial  value 3477.107894 
final  value 3133.450437 
converged
[1] 500.6281
</pre>
<p>
The hypothesis of no age differences in contraceptive choise is soundly 
rejected, with a chi-squared of 500.6 on 4 d.f. 
To see where the d.f. come from, note that the current model has six
parameters (two quadratics with three parameters each) and the null
model of course has only two (the two constants).
</p>
<p>
To test the goodness of fit of the quadratic model we compare it with
the saturated model fitted earlier:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> x2 <- deviance(mlq) - deviance(msat); x2
[1] 20.47457

> pchisq(x2, 8, lower.tail=FALSE)
[1] 0.008682221
</pre>
<p>
We get a deviance of 20.47 on 8 d.f. with a P-value of 0.0087,
so we have evidence that the model does not fit the data. 
We explore the lack of fit in a graph. 
</p>
<p>
The "deviances" reported by <code>multinom</code> for these models
are 5766.273 and 5745.798. They are calculated as -2logL where 
logL is the <i>individual</i> data log-likelihood. This is why
the "deviance" for the saturated model is not zero. Differences
among deviances, however, are correct.
</p>
<h4>Plotting Observed and Fitted Logits</h4>
<p>
Let us do Figure 6.1, comparing observed and fitted logits. The
observed logits may be calculated directly from the data or from
the saturated model.  To obtain smooth curves we evaluate the fitted
model at ages from 15 to 50 in steps of half a year.

<p>
The graph suggests that most of the lack of fit comes from overestimation 
of the relative odds of being sterilized compared to using no method at 
ages 15-19. Adding a dummy for this age group confirms the result:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> mlqt <- multinom(Y ~ age + agesq + I(ageg=="15-19"), data=cuse)
# weights:  15 (8 variable)
initial  value 3477.107894 
iter  10 value 2880.318358
final  value 2878.946949 
converged

> x2 <- deviance(mlqt) - deviance(msat); x2
[1] 12.09569

> pchisq(x2, 6, lower.tail=FALSE)
[1] 0.05986779
</pre>
<p>
The deviance is now only 12.10 on 6 d.f., so we pass the goodness of fit 
test. (We really didn't need the dummy in the equation for other methods, 
so the gain comes from just one d.f.)</p>
<p>
An important caveat with multinomial logit models is that we are 
modeling odds or relative probabilities, and it is always possible for 
the odds of one category to increase while the probability of that 
category declines, simply because the odds of another category increase 
more. To examine this possibility one can always compute predicted 
probabilities.</p>
<p> 
We pursue these issues at greater length in a discussion of the interpretation 
of multinomial logit coefficients, including the calculation of continuous and 
discrete marginal effects, in <a href="mlogit.html">an analysis available here</a>.

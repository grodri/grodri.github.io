<h3>2.8 Analysis of Covariance Models</h3>
<p>
We now consider models that combine continuous and categorical predictors,
traditionally called "ancova" models. We illustrate them by treating
social setting as a continuous covariate with a linear effect and
program effort as a discrete factor with three levels: low, medium
and strong:
</p>

I included the <code>data</code> parameter, even though the data are
attached, because that ensures propagation of row names when we use
extractor functions, and will be convenient when we consider diagnostics.
</p>
<p>
Compare the coefficients with Table 2.23 in the notes.
Countries with strong programs show steeper fertility declines, 
on average 19 percentage points more, than countries with weak programs 
and the same social setting.  
</p>
<p>
To test significance of the net effect of effort we call the
<code>anova()</code> function:

</pre>
<p>
Compare the results with Table 2.24 in the notes. We obtain an
F-ratio of 14.1 on 2 and 16 d.f.
</p>
<p>
This analysis has adjusted for linear effects of setting, whereas 
the analysis of <a href='c2s7.html'>Section 2.7</a> adjusted for
the effects of setting grouped in three categories.
As it happens, both analyses lead to similar estimates of the difference
between strong and weak programs at the same level of setting.
</p>
<h4>Plotting Observed and Fitted</h4> 
<p>
Let us do Figure 2.5, a plot of change versus setting identifying 
the level of program effort corresponding to each point.
I will also superimpose the three parallel lines corresponding
to the fitted model. 
</p>
<p>
This is easily done using <code>plot()</code> for the data
and <code>text()</code> for the labels. We could use <code>abline()</code>
for the fitted lines, but we will plot the actual fitted values instead,
so we restrict the lines to the values of setting where we actually 
have data for each level of effort
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> xy <- cbind(setting, fitted(m2cg))
> plot(setting, change, xlim=c(35,100))
> text(setting, change, labels=effort.g, pos=4, cex=0.75)
> lines(xy[effort.g=="Weak",])
> lines(xy[effort.g=="Moderate",])
> lines(xy[effort.g=="Strong",])
> dev.print(png,"fig25.png",width=500,height=400)

<p>
If you wanted to label the points using just the initials "w", "m","s",
you could write <code>labels=tolower(substr(effort.g,1,1))</code>,
using <code>substr()</code> to get the first character and 
<code>tolower()</code> to change it to lower case. 
</p>
<h4>Adjusted and Unadjusted Means</h4>
<p>
Let us turn to the comparison of adjusted and unadjusted declines 
in Table 2.26, a useful way to present regression results to a 
non-technical audience.
</p>
<p>
To obtain adjusted estimates we predict fertility change for each
country using its observed level of effort, but with social setting
set to the sample mean, which happens to be 72.1. One way
to do this is to obtain the model matrix, available through the 
extractor function <code>model.matrix</code>, change the setting
column to the mean, and then multiply by the coefficients
using <code>%*%</code> to denote matrix multiplication
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> X <- model.matrix(m2cg)
> X[,2] <- mean(setting)
> adj <- X %*%coef(m2cg)
</pre>
<p>
The next step is to compute observed and adjusted means for
each category of effort, which we can do with <code>tapply()</code>.
I bind the result using <code>data.frame</code> to get column names:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> data.frame(obs = tapply(change,effort.g, mean),
+            adj = tapply(adj,   effort.g, mean))
               obs       adj
Weak      5.000000  6.250163
Moderate  9.333333 10.394077
Strong   27.857143 25.697771
</pre>
<p>
Countries with strong programs average a 28% decline in fertility,
but they also tend to have higher settings; we estimate a slightly 
smaller decline of about 26% at average social setting.
The estimate is based on the model, which adjusts linearly for setting
and assumes that the slope is the same at all levels of effort.
The next step will be to examine this assumption.
</p>
<p>
The generic function <code>predict()</code> can calculate predictions
for various models. One of the arguments taken by this function is
a new dataset to use in the predictions. All we need is a three-row
dataset, with setting set to 72.1 and effort set to Weak, Moderate,
and Strong. The results are exactly the same as above.
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> pds<-data.frame(
+   setting=rep(mean(setting),3),
+   effort.g=levels(effort.g))

> pds
  setting effort.g
1    72.1     Weak
2    72.1 Moderate
3    72.1   Strong

> predict(m2cg,newdata=pds)
        1         2         3 
 6.250163 10.394077 25.697771 
</pre>
<p>
In this example we proceeded from  first principles because the 
calculations are easy to do, and you can see exactly what is 
being done.
</p>
<h4>The Assumption of Parallelism</h4> 
<p>
We will now allow the linear relationship between change and setting
to vary with level of effort, by introducing an interaction between
setting and the indicators of effort.
Before we do that we center the index of social setting by subtracting 
the mean, a practice I highly recommend to simplify the interpretation
of so-called "main"" effects when the model has interactions:
</p>
<pre class='r'>
> setting.c <- setting - mean(setting)
> m3cg <- lm(change ~ setting.c * effort.g)
> summary(m3cg)
Call:
lm(formula = change ~ setting.c * effort.g)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max

                           Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)

Residual standard error: 5.959 on 14 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.8124,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.7454 
F-statistic: 12.13 on 5 and 14 DF,  p-value: 0.0001112
</pre>
<p>
Compare the parameter estimates with Table 2.27 in the notes.
Because we centered setting, the coefficients for moderate and strong
programs summarize differences by effort at mean setting, rather than 
at setting zero (which is well outside the range of the data). 
Thus, fertility decline averages 13 percentage points more under strong 
than under weak programs in countries with average social setting. 
</p>
<p>
The interaction terms can be used to compute how these differences 
vary as we move away from the mean. 
For example in countries which are ten points above the mean social 
setting, the strong versus weak difference is  almost five percentage 
points more than at the mean. 
</p>
<p>
These differences, however, are not significant, as we verify
using the <code>anova()</code> function to reproduce Table 2.28:

</pre>
<p>
The F-ratio for the interaction is 0.4 on 2 and 14 d.f.,
so we have no evidence that the three slopes are not all the same.
</p>
<p>
<i>Exercise</i>. Plot the data and the regression lines implied
by the model with a linear setting by effort interaction. Note
how the difference between strong and weak programs increases with
social setting. The interaction is not significant, however, so
we have no evidence that the lines are not in fact parallel.

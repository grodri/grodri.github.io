<h2>  Piecewise Exponential Models</h2>
<p>  
This is an illustration of piecewise exponential survival using R, 
relying on the functions <code>survSplit()</code> to create pseudo-observations
and <code>glm()</code> to fit the model using the Poisson equivalence.
I also use the package <code>dplyr</code> for data manipulation.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">This page has been updated to use version 2.40-1
of the survival package, which was released on  October 30, 2016. 
The call to <code>survSplit()</code> now uses a formula interface. 
The old page <a href='/wws509/r/recidivism-old.html'>is here</a>.
Tip of the hat to Jack Hoskins for bringing this issue to my attention.</div>

<h4>The Data</h4>
 <p> 
The dataset we will consider is analyzed in Wooldridge (2002) and
credited to Chung, Schmidt and Witte (1991). The data pertain to a 
random sample of convicts released from prison between July 1, 1977
and June 30, 1978.  Of interest is the time until they return to
prison.  The information was collected retrospectively by looking at
records in April 1984, so the maximum length of observation is 81
months.  The data are available from the Stata website in binary
format. We use the <code>foreign</code> library to read them into R.
create an id and 
</p>
<pre class='R'>
&gt; library(foreign)
&gt; recid <- read.dta("http://www.stata.com/data/jwooldridge/eacsap/recid.dta")
&gt; nrow(recid)
[1] 1445
</pre>
<p>
  I get a warning that "R cannot read factor labels from Stata 5 files"
but it seems harmless, as the data look Ok.
The file has a censoring indicator, which we subtract from 1 to get
a failure indicator. We also create an id variable and list 
observation number 9, which goes back to prison after 54 months.
</p>
<pre class='R'>
&gt; recid <- mutate(recid, fail = 1 - cens, id = row_number())
&gt; filter(recid, id == 9) %>% select(id, durat, fail)
   id durat fail
1   9    54    1
</pre>
<h4>Creating Pseudo-Observations</h4>
<p>  
  To create pseudo-observations for survival analysis we will
use the <code>survSplit()</code> function in the `survival` package.
We will split the data into single-year
intervals of duration from 0-12 to 48-60 with an open-ended 
category 60+. </p>

<pre class='R'>
> library(survival)
> breaks <- seq(12, 60, by=12)
> recidx <- survSplit(Surv(durat, fail) ~ ., data = recid, 
+   cut = breaks, episode = "interval", start = "start")
</pre>
<p>The function codes the interval variable using 
integer codes, and we turn that into a factor for convenience
We calculate exposure time for each episode as the difference
between duration at the start and end.</p>
<pre class="R">
> recidx <- mutate(recidx, exposure = durat - start,  
+      interval = factor(interval,  labels = paste("(", 
+      c(0,breaks), ",", c(breaks,100), "]", sep=""))) %>%
+    rename(events = fail)
> nrow(recidx)
[1] 6718
</pre>
<p>
Finally we show how the observation for subject 9 above becomes
five pseudo-observations, with 12 months of exposure in years
one to four with no events, and 6 months of exposure in year 
five with one event. </p>
<pre class="R">
> filter(recidx, id == 9) %>% 
+   select(id, start, durat, interval, events, exposure)
   id start durat interval events exposure
1  9     0    12   (0,12]     0       12
2  9    12    24  (12,24]     0       12
3  9    24    36  (24,36]     0       12
4  9    36    48  (36,48]     0       12
5  9    48    54  (48,60]     1        6
</pre>

<h4>A PWE Proportional Hazards Model</h4>
<p>  
We are now ready to fit a proportional hazards model with
a piecewise exponential baseline where the hazard changes from
year to year. We use the same model as Wooldridge(2002),
involving ten predictors, all fixed covariates.
</p>
<pre class="R">
&gt; fit=glm(events~interval+workprg+priors+tserved+felon+alcohol+drugs+
+     black+married+educ+age+offset(log(exposure)), 
+      data=recidx, family=poisson)
&gt; summary(fit)

Call:
glm(formula = events ~ interval + workprg + priors + tserved + 
    felon + alcohol + drugs + black + married + educ + age + 
    offset(log(exposure)), family = poisson, data = recidx)

<p>
The results are exactly the same as in the 
<a href="..\stata\recidivism.html">sister page using Stata</a>. 
We see that the risk of recidivism is about the same
in the first two years, but then decreases substantially
with duration since release. 
At any given duration felons have 25% lower risk of recidivism than
non-felons with the same observed characteristics.  Subjects
imprisoned for alcohol or drug related offenses have much
higher risk of recidivism, everything else being equal.

<h4>Survival Probabilities</h4>
  
We now illustrate the calculation of survival probabilities.
We start with the baseline hazard, which we obtain by
adding the constant to the interval coefficients using zero 
for (0-12] to obtain log-hazards, and exponentiating to get 
hazards.
To obtain the cumulative or integrated hazard we multiply
each hazard by the width of the interval, which happens to be
12 for all intervals, and sum. 
We then obtain the survival as the exponential of the
negative cumulative hazard.
Note that we only need the first five years.
</p>
<pre class='R'>
&gt; b = coef(fit)
&gt; h = exp( b[1] + c(0,b[2:6]) )
&gt; H = cumsum( 12*h)
&gt; S = exp(-H)

</pre>
<p> These calculations apply to the reference cell and are
not very meaningful because they set age to zero (and age, 
by the way, is measured in months).  
</p><p>
We will now estimate the probability of staying out of prison 
for five years given average values of the predictors.
In calculating the mean of each predictor we have to be careful 
to include only one observation per person, so we restrict the 
calculation to the first interval, which is "(0,12]". 
To do this I extract the first row for each person and the
columns corresponding to fixed predictors into a matrix 
<code>X</code>. 
The relevant coefficients are in slots 7 to 16.
</p>
<pre class='R'>
> xvars = c("workprg","priors","tserved","felon","alcohol","drugs",
+   "black","married","educ","age")
> X = recidx[recidx$interval=="(0,12]", xvars]
> xbar = colMeans(X)
> bx = b[7:16]
> xb = sum(xbar * bx)
> exp(-H[5] * exp(xb))
interval(48,60] 
      0.6570278 
</pre>
<p>
Thus, the probability of staying out of prison for the average
person is 65.7%. We can easily calculate this probability for
felons and non-felons keeping all other variables at their
means. Note that felon is the 4-th predictor in <code>X</code>
</p>
<pre class='R'>
&gt; xb0 = sum(xbar[-4] * bx[-4])  
&gt; exp(-H[5] * exp(xb0))
interval(48,60] 
      0.6317763 
&gt; xb1 = xb0 + bx[4]
&gt; exp(-H[5] * exp(xb1))
interval(48,60] 
      0.7077168 
</pre>
<p>
The predicted probability is 70.8% for felons and 63.2% for 
non-felons when all other characteristics are set to the mean,
a difference of 7.6 percentage points.
</p><p>
An alternative calculation sets every person to be a felon
or non-felon leaving all other characteristics as they are,
and then averages the predicted probability of surviving
five years without returning to prison.
</p>
<pre class='R'>
&gt; felon = X[,"felon"]
&gt; X[,"felon"]= 0
&gt; xb = as.matrix(X) %*% bx

&gt; X[,"felon"]= 1
&gt; xb = as.matrix(X) %*% bx
&gt; mean(exp(-(H[5] * exp(xb))))
[1] 0.6857928
&gt; X[,"felon"] = felon
</pre>
<p>
The average probability of staying out of prison for five years
is 68.6% if a felon and 61.2% if not, a difference of 7.4 percentage
points.

<h2>7.A Piecewise Exponential Models</h2>
<p>This is an illustration of piecewise exponential survival models
using individual-level data. We use R, relying on the functions
<code>survSplit()</code> to create pseudo-observations and
<code>glm()</code> to fit the model using the Poisson equivalence. I
also use the package <code>dplyr</code> for data manipulation. The call
to <code>survSplit()</code> now uses a formula interface. Hat tip to
Jack Hoskins, who alerted me to this change starting with version
2.40-1.</p>
<div id="the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>The Data</h3>
<p>The dataset we will consider is analyzed in Wooldridge (2002) and
credited to Chung, Schmidt and Witte (1991). The data pertain to a
random sample of convicts released from prison between July 1, 1977 and
June 30, 1978. Of interest is the time until they return to prison. The
information was collected retrospectively by looking at records in April
1984, so the maximum length of observation is 81 months. The data are
available from the Stata website in Stata format.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; library(haven)
&gt; recid &lt;- read_dta(&quot;https://www.stata.com/data/jwooldridge/eacsap/recid.dta&quot;)
&gt; nrow(recid)</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 1445</code></pre>
<p>The file has a censoring indicator, which we subtract from 1 to get a
failure indicator. We also create an id variable and list observation
number 9, which goes back to prison after 54 months.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; library(dplyr)
&gt; recid &lt;- mutate(recid, fail = 1 - cens, id = row_number())
&gt; filter(recid, id == 9) |&gt; select(id, durat, fail)</code></pre>

</div>
<div id="creating-pseudo-observations" class="section level3">
<h3>Creating Pseudo-Observations</h3>
<p>To create pseudo-observations for survival analysis we will use the
<code>survSplit()</code> function in the <code>survival</code> package.
We will split the data into single-year intervals of duration, from 0-12
to 48-60, with an open-ended category 60+. The function codes the
interval variable using integer codes, and we turn that into a factor
for convenience. We calculate exposure time for each episode as the
difference between duration at the start and end. We list these data for
individual 9 to illustrate how the episodes are created.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; library(survival)
&gt; breaks &lt;- seq(12, 60, by=12)
&gt; recidx &lt;- survSplit(Surv(durat, fail) ~ ., data = recid, 
+   cut = breaks, episode = &quot;interval&quot;, start = &quot;start&quot;)
&gt; recidx &lt;- mutate(recidx, exposure = durat - start,
+ interval = factor(interval,  labels = 
+   paste(&quot;(&quot;, c(0,breaks), &quot;,&quot;, c(breaks,100), &quot;]&quot;, sep=&quot;&quot;))) |&gt;
+   rename(events = fail)
&gt; nrow(recidx)</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 6718</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; filter(recidx, id==9) |&gt; select(id,start,durat,interval, events, exposure)</code></pre>

<p>The sample observation, which goes back to prison after 54 months,
contributes five episodes or pseudo-observations; one each for years one
to four, with 12 months of exposure and no events, and another one for
year five, with 6 months of exposure and one event.</p>

<h3>A PWE Proportional Hazards Model</h3>
<p>We are now ready to fit a proportional hazards model with a piecewise
exponential baseline where the hazard changes from year to year. We use
the same model as Wooldridge(2002), involving ten predictors, all fixed
covariates. I specify the offset using the <code>exposure()</code>
option. I could, of course, take logs and then use the
<code>offset()</code> option.]{.stata}</p>

<p>We see that the risk of recidivism is about the same in the first two
years, but then decreases substantially with duration since release. At
any given duration, felons have 25% lower risk of recidivism than
non-felons with the same observed characteristics. Subjects imprisoned
for alcohol or drug related offenses have much higher risk of
recidivism, everything else being equal.</p>

<h3>Survival Probabilities</h3>
<p>We now illustrate the calculation of survival probabilities, starting
with the baseline hazard. <span class="stata">There are different ways
to do these calculations in Stata, but I will proceed from first
principles using Mata.</span>. We will retrieve the coefficients, add
the constant and the age effects to obtain the log hazard, exponentiate
to obtain hazards, multiply by 12 and sum to obtain the cumulative
baseline hazard, and then exponentiate to obtain the baseline survival.
This is not particularly meaningful as it would apply with all
covariates set to zero, including age, which is measured in months.</p>

<p>We will now estimate the probability of staying out of prison for
five years given average values of the predictors. First we calculate
the mean of each predictor; we have to be careful to include only one
observation per person, so we restrict the data to the first
interval.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; xvars &lt;- names(coef(fit))[7:16]
&gt; pset &lt;- filter(recidx, interval == &quot;(0,12]&quot;) |&gt;  select(xvars) </code></pre>
<pre><code>Note: Using an external vector in selections is ambiguous.
ℹ Use `all_of(xvars)` instead of `xvars` to silence this message.
ℹ See &lt;https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/faq-external-vector.html&gt;.
This message is displayed once per session.</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; means &lt;- colMeans(pset)</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the means, we multiply each by the corresponding
coefficient to obtain the linear predictor <code>xb</code>, exponentiate
to obtain a relative risk, multiply by the baseline hazard, and then
calculated the predicted survival.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; xb &lt;- sum(coef(fit)[xvars] * means)
&gt; exp(-(H * exp(xb)))[5]</code></pre>
<pre><code>interval(48,60] 
      0.6570278 </code></pre>
<p>Thus, the probability of staying out of prison for five years for the
average person is 65.7%.</p>
<p>We now calculate this probability for felons and non-felons, keeping
all other variables at their means. All we need to do is subtract from
<code>xb</code> the coefficient of felon times the mean, which gives the
linear predictor for a non-felon. We then add the coefficient of felon
to get the linear predictor for a felon. In both cases the other
variables stay at their means.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; xb0 &lt;- xb - coef(fit)[&quot;felon&quot;] * means[&quot;felon&quot;]
&gt; xb1 &lt;- xb0 + coef(fit)[&quot;felon&quot;]
&gt; data.frame(non.felon = exp(-H[5]*exp(xb0)), felon= exp(-H[5]*exp(xb1)))</code></pre>
<pre><code>                non.felon     felon
interval(48,60] 0.6317763 0.7077168</code></pre>
<p>The predicted probability is 70.8% for felons and 63.2% for
non-felons when all other characteristics are set to the mean, a
difference of 7.6 percentage points. This is a marginal effect at the
means.</p>
<p>An alternative calculation sets every person to be a felon or
non-felon, leaving all other characteristics as they are, and then
averages the predicted probability of surviving five years without
returning to prison.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; xb0 &lt;- as.matrix(mutate(pset, felon=0)) %*% coef(fit)[xvars]
&gt; xb1 &lt;- as.matrix(mutate(pset, felon=1)) %*% coef(fit)[xvars]
&gt; data.frame(non.felon=mean(exp(-H[5] * exp(xb0))), 
+                felon=mean(exp(-H[5] * exp(xb1))))</code></pre>
<pre><code>  non.felon     felon
1 0.6118797 0.6857928</code></pre>
<p>The average probability of staying out of prison for five years is
68.6% for felons 61.2% for non-felons, a difference of 7.4 percentage
points. This can be interpreted as an average marginal effect.</p>

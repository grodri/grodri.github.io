<h2 class="first"">Problem Set 4: Doctor Visits<br/>
<small>Due Friday, November 18, 2016</small> </h2>
<p>Cameron and Trivedi (2009) have some interesting data on the number 
of office-based doctor visits by adults aged 25-64 based on the 2002 
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We will use data for the most recent 
wave, available in the datasets section of the website as 
<code>docvis.dta</code>.</p>
<h3 id="a-poisson-model">[1] A Poisson Model</h3>
<p>(a) Fit a Poisson regression model with the number of doctor visits 
(<code>docvis</code>), as the outcome. We will use the same predictors 
as Cameron and Trivedi, namely health insurance status 
(<code>private</code>), health status (<code>chronic</code>), gender 
(<code>female</code>) and income (<code>income</code>), but will add 
two indicators of ethnicity (<code>black</code> and 
<code>hispanic</code>). There are many more variables one could add, 
but we'll keep things simple.</p>
<p>(b) Interpret the coefficient of <code>black</code> and test its 
significance using a Wald test and a likelihood ratio test.</p>
<p>(c) Compute a 95% confidence interval for the effect of private 
insurance and interpret this result in terms of doctor visits.</p>
<p>(d) Compute the deviance and Pearson chi-squared statistics for this 
model. Does the model fit the data? Is there evidence of 
overdispersion?</p>
<p>(e) Predict the proportion expected to have exactly zero doctor 
visits and compare with the observed proportion. You will find the 
formula for Poisson probabilities in the notes. The probability of zero 
is simply <span 
class="math"><em>e</em><sup> − <em>μ</em></sup></span>.</p>
<h3 id="poisson-overdispersion">[2] Poisson Overdispersion</h3>
<p>(a) Suppose the variance is proportional to the mean rather than 
equal to the mean. Estimate the proportionality parameter using 
Pearson's chi-squared and use this estimate to correct the standard 
errors.</p>
<p>(b) What happens to the significance of the black coefficient once 
we allow for extra-Poisson variation? Could we test this coefficient 
using a likelihood ratio test? Explain.</p>
<p>(c) Compare the standard errors adjusted for over-dispersion with 
the robust or &quot;sandwich&quot; estimator of the standard errors.</p>
<h3 id="a-negative-binomial-model">[3] A Negative Binomial Model</h3>
<p>(a) Fit a negative binomial regression model using the same outcome 
and predictors as in part 1.a. Comment on any remarkable changes in the 
coefficients.</p>
<p>(b) Interpret the coefficient of black and test its significance 
using a Wald test and a likelihood ratio test. Compare your results 
with parts 1.b and 2.b</p>
<p>(c) Predict the percent of respondents with zero doctor visits 
according to this model and compare with part 1.e. You will find a 
formula for negative binomial probabilities in the addendum to the 
notes. The probability of zero is given by <span class="math">
[<em>β</em> / (<em>μ</em> + <em>β</em>)]<sup><em>α</em></sup>
</span> where <span class="math">
<em>α</em> = <em>β</em> = 1 / <em>σ</em><sup>2</sup></span>.</p>

<p>(d) Interpret the estimate of <span 
class="math"><em>σ</em><sup>2</sup></span> in this model and test its 
significance, noting carefully the distribution of the criterion.</p>
<p>(e) Use predicted values from this model to divide the sample into 
twenty groups of about equal size, compute the mean and variance of 
<code>docvis</code> in each group, and plot these values. Superimpose 
curves representing the over-dispersed Poisson and negative binomial 
variance functions and comment.</p>
<h3 id="a-zero-inflated-poisson-model">[4] A Zero-Inflated Poisson 
Model</h3>
<p>(a) Try a zero-inflated Poisson model with the same predictors of 
part 1a in both the Poisson and inflate equations.</p>
<p>(b) Predict the proportion of respondents with zero doctor visits 
according to this model and compare with 1.e and 3.c. (Don't forget 
that there are two ways of having an outcome of zero in this model.)</p>
<p>(c) Interpret the coefficients of black in the two equations. Is the 
effect related to whether blacks visit the doctor at all? To how often 
they visit?</p>
<h3 id="model-selection">[5] Model Selection</h3>
<p>Considering the results obtained so far and bearing in mind 
parsimony and goodness of fit, which of the models used here provides 
the best description of the data? Make sure you provide a clear 
justification of your choice.</p>

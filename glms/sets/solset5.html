to Problem Set 5: <br/> Irish Educational Transitions</h2>
<p><a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets">Statlib</a> is an
excellent source of statistical data and programs. Their <a
href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/irish.ed">Irish Educational
Transitions</a> dataset has data for 500 Irish school children aged 11
in 1967. The outcome of interest is educational attainment, which for
purposes of this analysis I have recoded in <code>educg</code> in three
categories: junior, senior, and 3rd level.</p>
<p>The predictors of interest are <code>gender</code>, a measure of
father’s occupational prestige which I have recoded into quartiles in
<code>prestigeg</code>, and the score in a reasoning test, which I also
recoded into quartiles in <code>reasong</code>. The file
<code>irished.dta</code> in the datasets section includes these recodes
and drops primary school leavers and a few cases with missing data, for
an effective sample size of 435.</p>

<p>We find that the average probability of achieving third level is
practically the same for females and comparable males, only 0.34
percentage points lower. (The other two marginal effects tell us that
they have a lower probability of junior level, compensated almost
exactly by a higher probability of senior level, namely -5.48 and 5.82
for a net difference of 0.34.)</p>
<p>(d) Reestimate the average marginal effect of gender on the
probability of achieving 3rd level using the exact discrete calculation,
also “by hand”.</p>
<p>To do this calculation we need to set gender to female and then to
male, predict the probabilities each time, and then compute discrete
differences and average</p>

<p>The results are <em>very</em> similar to the continuous calculation.
Girls have almost the same probability of achieving third level as
comparable boys, on average 0.35 percentage points lower. (The other two
discrete differences show a lower probability of junior level of 5.45
percentage points compensated by a higher probability of senior level of
5.80 points.)</p>
<p>(e) How would you go about testing the goodness of fit of this model
considering that we have individual data? No need to do anything, just
explain what you would do.</p>
<p>The deviance does not have a chi-squared distribution with individual
data, so we need to create groups. Fortunately all predictors are
categorical variables, with 32 possible combinations of gender and
quartiles of occupational prestige and resoning score. We could group
the data into these 32 groups, and then the deviance distribution should
be well approximated by a chi-squared distribution, as the groups would
average almost 14 observations each.</p>
<h3 id="sequential-logits">[2] Sequential Logits</h3>

where you first focus on the probability of going beyond the junior
level, and then look at the conditional probability of achieving 3rd

estimating a higher probability of going beyond the junior level, but

<p>We find a difference of half a percentage point, not unlike the 0.34
we found in the previous model, indicating essentially no gender
differences in the overall probability of reaching third level.</p>
<p>(d) Compare the sequential and multinomial logit models in terms of
parsimony, goodness of fit, and how well they represent gender
differences in educational attaintment.</p>

</pre>
<p>The models have very similar log-likelihoods, -365.4 for the
multinomial logit and -365.6 for the sequential logit, with a tiny
difference in favor of multinomial logits, and exactly the same number
of parameters, so there really isn’t much to choose here. From what we
have seen, they also lead to similar predictions by gender, so from this
point of view we could declare it a tie.</p>
<p>Taking a closer look, the generally small gender differences are
confined to the contrast between junior and senior levels, which happens
to be one of the two contrasts in the multinomial logit model, so that
would be a point in its favor. On the other hand, the sequential logit
model shows that girls have a higher probability of going beyond junior,
but then a lower conditional probability of continuing to third, which I
think shows more clearly what’s going on. This would tip the balance
towards sequential logits.</p>
<p>(e) Comment of the coefficients that correspond to children in the
top quartile of the reasoning test. Do we need marginal effects to
determine if they have a higher probability of reaching 3rd level than
comparable children with lower scores?</p>
<p>In case it was not clear this question refers just to the sequential
logit model. In this model, children in the top quartile of reasoning
scores, compared with children in lower quartiles, with the same gender
and parental occupational prestige, have a higher probability of going
beyond junior level and <em>also</em> a higher conditional probability
of continuing to third level given that they went beyond junior, so
obviously the overall probability is also higher. Marginal effects are
clearly not needed to settle this issue.</p>
<p>(If you think in terms of the multinomial logit model, the answer is
not so clear. Kids in the upper quartile of reasoning have higher
relative probabilities of senior compared to junior, and generally much
higher relative probabilities or third compared to junior, so it looks
like the overall probability of third level should be higher, but I
would compute marginal effects to make sure. In fact they do.)</p>

<p>The model is clearly more parsimonious than the previous ones, using
only 9 parameters instead of 16, a savings of 7. The log-likelihood of
-370.4 is 4.9 points lower than the multinomial logit model, so the fit
is a bit worse. Using Akaike’s criterion, with a deviance penalty of two
points per parameter, we obtain a small advantage of 4.1 points for the
ordered logit model.</p>
<p>In terms of representing gender differences, however, the ordered
logit model is not as good as the previous ones, because it assumes a
uniform shift in academic achievement. This should result in girls
having higher progressions from junior to senior as well as senior to
third, whereas the evidence indicates that they have a somewhat higher
probability of progressing to senior level but then a somewhat lower
probability of continuing to third level, so in the end we see no gender
differences in the probability of achieving third level.</p>

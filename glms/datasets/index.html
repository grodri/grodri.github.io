<h2 class="first">Datasets</h2> 

<p style="clear:both">This is a collection of small datasets used in the course,
classified by the  type of statistical technique that may be used to analyze them.
A couple of datasets appear in more than one category.
The datasets are now available in Stata format as well as
two plain text formats, as explained <a href='#formats'>below</a>.
They can all be read from the datasets section of this website, as illustrated
in the Stata and R logs.

<h3><a name='formats'></a>Data Formats</h3> 
<p> 
<img src="/images/notepad.png" class="icon" align="left"/>&nbsp;All datasets are available as 
<span class='em'>plain-text</span> ASCII files, usually in two formats:</p> 
<ul> 
<p><li>The copy with extension <code>.dat</code> has a header line 
with the variable names, and codes categorical variables using character strings.
This version is best for users of S-Plus or R  and can be read using <code>read.table()</code>. 
Some files do not have column names; in these cases use <code>header=FALSE</code>.
</li></p> 
 
<p><li>The copy with extension <code>.raw</code> 
omits the header line and codes all variable using 
numeric codes. This version is better for users of
Stata or other packages that prefer numerical codes.
(However, Stata <i>can</i> read the character version if you
specify the string width using <code>str</code>.)
</li></p> 
</ul> 
<p>
To download any of these files using your browser I
recommend that you right-click and choose 'save as...'.
If you left-click what happens next depends on how your
browser is configured to handle these file types,
and will often require an extra step.
</p><p> 
<img src="/images/stata12s.png" class="icon" align="left" /> 
&nbsp;The datasets are also available as 
<span class='em'>Stata system files</span> 
with extension <code>.dta</code>, and can be read
directly from net-aware Stata versions 10 or higher
via the <code>use</code> command.
This is the easiest method for Stata users.
You can also right click on the links to save a local copy.
R users can read the Stata files using the 
<code>read_dta()</code> function in the <code>haven</code> package.

The "raw' data file codes the factor levels in order of
appearance as follows:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Proximity: 1 = close, 2=distant</li> 
<li>Contact: 1 = frequent, 2=infrequent</li> 
<li>Norms: 1=favorable, 2=unfavorable</li> 
</ul> 
<p>For regression analysis it would have been better to code these variables 
using 1 and 0 instead of 1 and 2, and rename them to something like proximClose, 
contactFreq, and normsFav. I haven't done this because it might break existing
code, but the new variables can easily be added.

These are the Madsen data used in the revised lecture notes.
This is a four-way table classifying 1681 residents of twelve areas
in Copenhagen in terms of: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> the type of housing they had (1=tower
blocks, 2=apartments, 3=atrium houses and 4=terraced houses),
<li>their feeling of influence on apartment management (1=low, 2=medium,3=high),
<li>their degree of contact with neighbors (1=low, 2=high), and 
<li> their satisfaction with housing conditions (1=low, 2=medium, 3=high).

<p> 
This dataset comes from the Guatemalan Survey of Family Health, a survey of rural
women that contains detailed data on care received during pregnancy and delivery 
along with extensive background information.</p> 
<p> We have tabulated data on 3334
pregnancies. The outcome is the type of provider seen during pregnancy and
there are three predictors. The raw data file has five columns, as follows:
</p> 

<ul> 
<li>eth = Ethnicity/Language, coded 1=Indigenous, non-spanish speaker,
2=Indigenous, spanish speaker, and 3= ladino.
<li>migr = Migration, whether the community has frequent migration abroad,
coded 1=yes, 0=no.
<li>avail = Availability of modern health services within one hour of the community,
coded 1=yes, 0=no.
<li>type = Provider type, coded 1=none, 2=midwife, 3=health post and 4=doctor.
<small>For simplicity, women seeing multiple provider types during their
pregnancy were coded using the most modern type; for example women
seeing both a midwife and a doctor were coded under doctor.</small>
<li>n = Count of the number of women in each category defined by
the previous four columns.
</ul> 
<p> 
The data are available using numeric codes as <a href="/datasets/healthCare.raw">healthCare.raw</a> 
and using string codes as well as row and column labels as <a href="/datasets/healthCare.dat">healthCare.dat</a>. Here's are a few lines from the latter:</p>

<p> 
The data show the length of remission in weeks for two
groups of leukemia patients, treated and control, and were 
analyzed by Cox in his original proportional hazards paper.
The data are available in a file containing three columns:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Treatment: coded Treated (drug) or Control (placebo),
<li> Time: weeks of remission,
<li> Failure: coded 1 if a failure (relapse), 0 if censored
</ul> 
<p>Thus, the third and fourth observations, 6 and 6+,
corresponding to a death and a censored observation at six weeks, 
are coded 6, 1 and 6, 0, respectively.</p> 
<p> 
The data are available in the usual two plain-text formats in
<a href="/datasets/gehan.dat">gehan.dat</a> 
and
<a href="/datasets/gehan.raw">gehan.raw</a> 
(group codes are  1=control, 2=treated),
and as a Stata file in

These data actually come from a matched-pairs design,
where patients were paired according to remission status 
(partial or complete) and then randomly assigned to the treated 
or control group, but most analyses have ignored this fact.

<div id="somoza"><h3>The Somoza Dataset </h3> 
<p> 
These are Somoza's data on infant and child survival in
Colombia, used in the notes (Table 3). The dataset comes from the Word 
Fertility Survey, which was fielded in Colombia in 1976.
Women in the reproductive ages were asked about their children
and these were tabulated by sex, year of birth (cohort), 
survival status and age at death or at interview.</p> 
<p> 
The file has 48 lines, corresponding to the 48 combinations of
sex, cohort and age, and six columns:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> sex: 1=Male or 2=Female,
<li> cohort: 1=1941-59, 2=1960-67 or 3=1968-76,
<li> age: 0-1/12, 1/12-3/12, 3/12-6/12, 1/2-1, 1-2, 2-5, 5-10 or 10+,
coded 1 to 8 in this order
<li> dead: number dead in this category
<li> alive: number alive at interview 
</ul> 
<p>The data are available in plain text format as
<a href="/datasets/somoza.dat">somoza.dat</a>,
which uses character labels for sex, cohort and age,
and <a href="/datasets/somoza.raw">somoza.raw</a>,
which uses numeric codes for all variables,
and in Stata format as <a href="/datasets/somoza.dta">somoza.dta</a>
A brief excerpt of the dat file is shown below.</p>
<pre>
    sex cohort        age   dead  alive
   Male 1941-59    0-1/12     99      0

<p> 
In order to analyze these data using piece-wise exponential models
you first have to calculate events and exposure by sex, cohort and age.
The details of this calculation are shown in our Stata logs.

<p> 
This dataset, adapted from an example in the software package aML,
is based on a longitudinal survey conducted in the U.S.</p> 
<p> 
The unit of observation is the couple and the event of interest is
divorce, with interview and widowhood treated as censoring events.
We have three fixed covariates: education of the husband and
two indicators of the couple's ethnicity: whether the husband is
black and whether the couple is mixed. The variables are: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>id: a couple number.
<li>heduc: education of the husband, coded 
<ul><li>0 = less than 12 years,
<li>	1 = 12 to 15 years, and
<li>	2 = 16 or more years.</ul> 
<li>heblack: coded 1 if the husband is black and 0 otherwise
<li>mixed: coded 1 if the husband and wife have different
ethnicity (defined as black or other), 0 otherwise. 
<li>years: duration of marriage, from the date of wedding to
divorce or censoring (due to widowhood or interview).
<li>div: the failure indicator, coded 1 for divorce and 0 for censoring.
</ul> 
<p> 
The dataset has 3771 couples and is available in "raw" format
as <a href="/datasets/divorce.raw">divorce.raw</a> and in  "dat" format

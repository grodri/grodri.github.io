<p> 
The material of this course is covered in detail in the lecture notes. 
The following references are pointers to more detailed supplementary discussions,
classified by subject.</p>

		<h4>Linear Models</h4>
		<p> 
Weisberg, S. (2013). 
<i>Applied Linear Regression</i>, 4th Edition. 
New York: John Wiley and  Sons. 
My favorite regression text, with good coverage of the basics and 
a lucid presentation of regression diagnostics.

		<p> 
Fox, J. (2015). 
<i>Applied Regression Analysis and Generalized Linear Models</i>, 3rd Edition. 
Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications. 
A nice discussion aimed at sociologists and other social scientists, 
with plenty of examples. The second edition expanded the treatment of
generalized linear models in Chapters 14 and 15, a change reflected in a new title.
A third edition was published recently.

		<h4>Generalized Linear Models</h4>
		<p> 
McCullagh, P. and Nelder, J.A. (1989). 
<i>Generalized Linear Models</i>, 2nd Edition. 
London: Chapman and Hall. 
The "bible" on generalized linear models, absolutely brilliant but
rather on the terse side. Aimed at the more advanced statistics student.

data with emphasis on post-estimation aids to interpretation and 
effective use of Stata. 
</p>
		<p> 
Gelman, A. and Hill, J. (2006).

<h2 class='first'>4. Poisson Models in Stata</h2> 
<P> 
This unit illustrates the use of Poisson regression for modeling
count data. We will be using the <code>poisson</code> command,
often followed by <code>estat gof</code> to compute the model's
deviance, which we can use as a goodness of fit test
with both individual and grouped data.
<P> 
An alternative way to fit these models is to use the <code>glm</code> 
command to fit generalized linear models in the Poisson family with
link log. An advantage of that command is that it reports the deviance
and Pearson's chi-squared statistics. There's also an option to
adjust standard errors for extra-Poisson variation. We will
illustrate its use in the context of models for overdispersed count data.
<P> 
<h3> 4.3 A Poisson Model for Counts</h3> 
<P> 
We will use the data from Fiji on children ever born that appear on Table 4.1
 of the lecture notes.
The data are available on our datasets page at 
<a href='http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/#ceb'> 
http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets</a> 
in both plain text and Stata formats. 
We will read the Stata file:
</p> 
<pre class='stata'>
. use http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/ceb, clear
(Children Ever Born Data, Fiji, 1976)
</pre> 
<P> 
The file has 70 observations, one for each cell in the table.
Each observation has a sequence number, numeric codes for
marriage duration, residence and education, the mean and variance
of children ever born, and the number of women in the cell.
</p> 
<h4>Mean-Variance Relationship</h4> 
<P> 
We start by doing Figure 4.1, plotting the cell variances versus
the cell means using a log-log-scale for cell with at least 20 cases.
Because Stata has an option to use log scales we don't need to 
take logs ourselves:
</p>
<pre class='stata'>
. twoway (scatter var mean if n > 20) ///
>   (function y=x, range (.7 7.8)) ///

>   title("Figure 4.1. Mean-Variance Relationship") ///
>   subtitle("Children Ever Born in Fiji, 1976")

(file c4fig1.png written in PNG format)
</pre> 
<P> 
<img src="c4fig1.png" class="img-responsive center-block"/> 
<P> 
Clearly the variance increases with the mean. 
Most of the points lie below the 45 degree line, indicating that the 
variance is not exactly equal to the mean.
Still, the assumption of proportionality brings as much closer to the 
data than the assumption of constant variance.
<P> 
<h4>Response, Offset and Predictors</h4> 
<P> 
The dataset does not have information about the number of children
ever born (CEB) to each woman, but it turns out we can still model 
the mean by working with the cell totals  and introducing the log 
of the number of women in the cell as an <i>offset</i>. 
<P> 
If the number of CEB to <u>one</u> woman in a given cell is a 
Poisson random variable with mean (and variance) &mu;,
then the number born to all <i>n</i> women in that cell is a
Poisson r.v. with mean (and variance) <i>n</i>&mu;. 
The log of the expected sum is log(n)+log(&mu;), and consists of 
a known offset and the quantity we are interested in modeling. 
See the notes for further details
<P> 
We therefore start by computing the outcome, the total CEB in each
cell, and the offset:
<pre class='stata'>
. gen y = round( mean * n, 1)
 
. gen os = log(n)
</pre> 
<P> 
We also need dummy variables for the predictors. I will
use local macros to store the names of the dummies that go with
each predictor:
<pre class='stata'>
. // duration (reference is 0-4)
. gen dur0509 = dur == 2
 
. gen dur1014 = dur == 3
 
. gen dur1519 = dur == 4
 
. gen dur2024 = dur == 5
 
. gen dur2529 = dur == 6
 
. local dur dur0509 dur1014 dur1519 dur2024 dur2529
 
. // residence (reference is Fiji)
. gen urban = res == 2
 
. gen rural = res == 3
 
. local res urban rural
 
.  // education (reference is None)
. gen lowerPri = educ == 2
 
. gen upperPri = educ == 3
 
. gen secPlus = educ == 4
 
. local educ lowerPri upperPri secPlus
</pre> 
<P> 
<h4> The Null Model</h4> 
<P> 
We are ready to fit the null model, which has an offset 
but no predictors. 
<pre class='stata'>

<P> 
The constant is the log of the mean number of children ever born.
Exponentiating we see that the estimated mean is almost four
children per woman. The estimate coincides with the sample mean,
as we verified by averaging the cell means with the number of women 
as a frequency weight.
<P> 
The deviance of 3,732 on 69 d.f. gives a clear indication that the
model doesn't fit the data. The hypothesis that the expected number
of CEB is the same for all women regardless of marriage duration,
residence and education, is soundly rejected,
<P> 
In rate models the offset usually represent the log of exposure,
and Stata lets us specify it directly using the <code>offset()</code> 
option with the name of the variable representing the offset, 
or using the <code>exposure()</code> option with the name of the
variable representing exposure, in which case Stata takes the log.
<P> 
<h4>One-Factor Models</h4>

Next we fit the three one-factor models, starting with residence:

</pre> 
<P> 
The estimates show that women in urban and rural areas have on
average 16 and 26% more children than women in Suva. The model
chi-squared of 73 on 2 d.f. tells us that this model is a significant
improvement over the null. The deviance, still in the thousands, 
tells us that this model is far from fitting the data.

<P> 
The estimates show that the number of CEB declines substantially with
education. Women with secondary education or more have 71% fewer
children than women with no education (or only 29% as many).
The educational differential is highly significant, but this model
doesn't fit the data.

</pre> 
<P> 
Not surprisingly the number of CEB is much higher for women who have
been married longer. This is by far the most important predictor of 
CEB, with a chi-squared of 3,566 on just 5 d.f. 
In fact, a demographer wouldn't even have looked at models that did 
not include a control  for duration of marriage. 
It's nice to see that Poisson regression can uncover the obvious :)
Note that this model still doesn't fit the data.
<P> 
The deviances given in this section are pretty close to the deviances
in Table 4.3 of the notes. You will notice small differences due to 
the use of different rounding procedures. In the notes we multiplied 
the mean CEB by the number of women and retained a few decimals. Here 
we rounded the total number of CEB to the nearest integer. If you 
omit the rounding you will reproduce the results in the notes exactly.
<P> 
<h4>Two-Factor Models</h4> 
<P> 
We now consider models that take two of the three factors into account.
Following the notes we consider only models that include duration of
marriage, an essential control when we study cumulative fertility.
This leaves two models with main effects of two factors, and another
two models that add one interaction.
<P> 
Because we are only interested in deviances I will run the
estimation commands quietly.
I will also use factor variables because it simplifies specifying the 
models. You can always build the dummies from first principles.
<P> 
So here are the additive models
<pre class='stata'>
. quietly poisson y i.dur i.res , offset(os)
 
. estat gof
 
         Goodness-of-fit chi2  =  120.6806

         Prob > chi2(61)       =    0.0012
</pre> 
<P> 
And here are the models with one interaction
<pre class='stata'>
. quietly poisson y i.dur#i.res , offset(os)

         Goodness-of-fit chi2  =  108.8968

</pre> 
<P> 
The best fit so far is the model that includes duration and 
education, but it exhibits significant lack of fit with a 
chi-squared of 84.5 on 46 d.f.
<P> 
<h4>The Three-Factor Additive Model</h4> 
<P> 
We are now ready to look at models that include all three factors.
We start with the additive model. 
I will use dummy variables because it makes the output a bit clearer,
but we can get exactly the same result with factor variables.

Briefly the estimates indicate that the number of CEB increases
rapidly with marital duration, in each category of residence and
education women married 15-19 years have five times as
many children as those married less than five years.  Women
who live in urban and rural areas have 12% and 16% more children
than women who live in Suva and have the same marriage duration
and education. Finally, more educated women have fewer children,
with women with secondary or more education reporting 27% fewer
children than women with no education who live in the same type
of place of residence and have been married just as long.

<h4>Three-Factor Models with Interactions</h4> 
<P> 
We now put the additive model to some "stress tests" by considering 
all possible interactions. I will use factor variables for
simplicity and <code>quietly</code> to save space.

These calculations complete Table 4.3 in the notes.
I reported the deviances for consistency with the notes,
but could just as well have reported likelihood ratio tests
comparing each of these models to the additive model.
Make sure you know how to use the output to test, for example, 
whether we need to add a duration by education interaction.
It should be clear from the list of deviances that we don't
need to add any of these terms. 
We conclude that the additive model does a fine job indeed.
<P> 
it's important to note that the need for interactions depends
exactly on what's being modeled. Here we used the log link,
so all effects are <i>relative</i>. In this scale no interactions
are needed. If we used the identity link we would be modeling
the actual number of children ever born and all effects would
be <i>absolute</i>. In that scale we would need, at the very
least, interactions with duration of marriage. 
See the notes for further discussion.
<P> 
Note 1: some of these models may fail in older versions of Stata, 
which by default allowed up to 40 parameters per model. 
The solution is to increase the maximum using the command
<code>set matsize 60</code>. 
Stata 9 increased the default to 200, which is more than we 
need for all of these models.
<P> 
Note 2: If you are using the <code>xi</code> prefix and look at 
the detailed output you will see that Stata drops some 
variables due to multicollinearity. This is usually no cause
for alarm.  The <code>xi</code> prefix is not terribly smart
in handling factors involved in more than one interaction and
will try to include the main effects twice. When this happens
the variables dropped are the copies and the originals are
already included in the model, as you can verify by inspecting
the listing.

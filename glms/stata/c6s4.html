<h2 class="first" id="c6s4">6.4 The Sequential Logit Model</h2>
<p>We now fit the <em>hierarchical</em> logit model described in the
notes. Because the term hierarchical has come to be closely associated
with multilevel models, I now prefer calling this model the
<em>sequential</em> logit model, reflecting the fact that the model
proceeds as if decisions were made in a sequence of stages.</p>
<p>This model is not to be confused with the <em>nested</em> logit
model, a term used in econometrics to refer to a random-utility model
where the errors within subsets of choices are correlated and the
predictors include alternative-specific variables. Our approach is much
simpler, but doesn’t have a strict utility maximization
interpretation.</p>
<p>We assume that women first decide whether to use a method or not, and
model this choice using a conventional logit model. We then focus
exclusively on women who use a method, and model their choice of
sterilization or another method using another conventional logit model.
(I told you this would be simpler :)</p>

<p>We have stored the log-likelihood and predicted the probability of
using a contraceptive method for each age group for later use.</p>
<p>The estimates indicate that the odds of using contraception
(sterilization or other method as opposed to no method) increase with
age to reach a maximum at 34.7 and then decline. This is more easily
appreciated in a graph, which we will do below.</p>
<h3 id="the-choice-of-method-among-users">The Choice of Method Among

<p>For the second step we look just at current users, and model the

woman uses contraception as a quadratic function of age:</p>

</pre>
<p>Again we have stored the log-likelihood and predicted the conditional
probabilities for each age group for later use.</p>
<p>The estimates indicate that the odds of begin sterilized among users
(sterilization as opposed to other method) increase with age, but at a
decreasing rate, reaching a maximum at 43.6. Again, a picture is worth a
tousand words and we will plot these curves below.</p>
<h3 id="comparing-model-likelihoods-and-deviances">Comparing Model
Likelihoods and Deviances</h3>
<p>To obtain the log-likehood for the sequential model we simply add the
log-likelihoods for each stage. We can then compare this to the
log-likelihood for a saturated multinomial model to get a sequential
logit deviance.</p>
<pre class='stata'>. scalar ll_seq = ll_s + ll_u

. quietly mlogit cuse i.ageg [fw=cases], base(3)

. scalar dev = 2*(e(ll) - ll_seq)

. di "deviance =",%6.2f dev,"df =", 14 - 6, "p-value =", ///
>   %5.3f chi2tail(8, dev)
deviance =  16.89 df = 8 p-value = 0.031
</pre>
<p>The deviance of 16.89 on 8 d.f. is a bit better (lower) than the
comparable multinomial logit model of <a href="c2s6">Section 6.2</a>
with linear and quadratic effects of age, which was ??? although the
difference is small and we have some evidence that the model does not
fit the data. We will build a plot to examine where the lack of fit
comes from.</p>
<h3 id="plotting-observed-and-fitted-logits">Plotting Observed and
Fitted Logits</h3>
<p>We now produce a figure similar to 6.1, but for the sequential logit
model. We could produce <em>observed</em> logits from logit models
treating age as a factor with seven levels, but we can easily compute
these “by hand”.</p>
<pre class='stata'>. gen obs_u = log((cases[_n]+cases[_n+1])/cases[_n+2]) if cuse==1
(14 missing values generated)

. gen obs_s = log( cases[_n]/cases[_n+1]) if cuse==1
(14 missing values generated)
</pre>
<p>We can then plot observed versus fitted logits for each equation:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. graph twoway (scatter obs_u age, mc(green)) ///

</pre>
<p><img src="fig62.png" class="img-responsive center-block stata" /></p>
<p>We see that the two quadratics fit reasonably well, except for
overestimating the probability of sterilization among contraceptive
users at ages 15 to 19, a problem similar to that noted in the
multinomial logit model. We could easily remedy this deficiency by
adding a dummy variable for teenagers in the second-stage model.</p>
<p><em>Exercise</em>. In the next section we will study ordered logit
models. You may want to try fitting an ordered logit model to this
dataset treating the three choices as ordered in terms of contraceptive
effectiveness.</p>

<h2 class='first'>6.  Multinomial Response Models in Stata</h2> 
<P> 
This section deals with regression models for discrete data with more than 
two response categories, where the assumption of a multinomial distribution 
is appropriate. 
We fill focus on three Stata commands,
<code>mlogit</code> for multinomial logits,
<code>ologit</code> for ordered logits, and
<code>oprobit</code> for ordered probit models,
with a brief mention of <code>asclogit</code> for
alternative-specific conditional logit models. 
We will also have occassion to use an old friend,
<code>logit</code>, for fitting sequential logit models.
(In line with the current syllabus we are skipping
log-linear models for contingency tables and thus
their relationship with multinomial logit models.)

<h3>6.1 The Nature of Multinomial Data</h3> 
<P> 
We start by reading the data on contraceptive choice by age, 
found in Table 6.1 of the lecture notes.
We will read the 7 by 3 table as 21 observations and treat the 
counts as frequency weights:

<P> 
With only one predictor this example affords limited opportunities for
interpreting coefficients, but will allow us to focus on the outcome
and the comparisons underlying each type of model.

<h2 class="first" id="c2s8">2.8 Analysis of Covariance Models</h2>
<p>We now consider models that include as predictors a continuous
variable and a discrete factor, sometimes called <em>ancova</em> models.
As usual, we read the data and group effort into categories, so we can
run this unit by itself.</p>

</pre>
<p>The <code>anova</code> command in Stata can also fit analysis of
covariance models, but we will continue to use regression with factor
variables via <code>regress</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s the model treating social setting as a covariate with a linear
effect and program effort as a factor variable with three categories</p>

<p>Here we told Stata that <code>effort_g</code> is a factor and, by
omission, that <code>setting</code> is a covariate. (There is a
<code>c.</code> prefix for covariates, but it is implied in regression
commands, except for interactions, as we’ll see soon.)</p>
<p>Compare the coefficients with Table 2.23 in the notes. Countries with
strong programs show steeper fertility declines, on average 19
percentage points more, than countries with weak programs and the same
social setting.</p>
<p>To test the significance of the net effect of effort we use the
<code>testparm</code> command.</p>
<pre class='stata'>. testparm i.effort_g

 ( 1)  2.effort_g = 0
 ( 2)  3.effort_g = 0

       F(  2,    16) =   14.05
            Prob > F =    0.0003
</pre>
<p>We obtain an F-ratio of 14.1 on 2 and 16 d.f., a significant result.
[The complete anova in Table 2.24 in the notes can be obtained from the
model with a linear effect of setting in <a href="c2s4">Section 2.4</a>
and the present model.]{stata}</p>
<p>This analysis has adjusted for linear effects of setting, whereas the
analysis in <a href="c2s7">Section 2.7</a> adjusted for differences by
setting grouped in three categories. As it happens, both analyses lead
to similar estimates of the difference between strong and weak programs
at the same level of setting.</p>
<h3 id="plotting-observed-and-fitted">Plotting Observed and Fitted</h3>
<p>Let us do Figure 2.5, a plot of change versus setting identifying the
level of program effort corresponding to each point. I will also
superimpose the three parallel lines corresponding to the fitted
model.</p>
<p>This is easily done using the <code>graph twoway</code> command
–which can be shortened to <code>twoway</code>– to combine a
<code>scatter</code> plot with three <code>line</code> plots, one for
each category of effort.</p>
<pre class='stata'>. predict ancovafit
(option xb assumed; fitted values)

</pre>
<p><img src="fig25.png" class="img-responsive center-block stata" /></p>
<p>Note how each subplot can have its own <code>if</code> condition. We
also specify the <code>sort</code> option, which determines the order in
which the points are drawn, pretty important when they will be joined by
lines. (Try <code>line change setting</code> to see what can happen if
you do a line plot on unsorted data. With a linear fit like Figure 2.5
the consequence of leaving out <code>sort</code> is not apparent because
all the points lie in a straight line.)</p>
<p>If you wanted to label the points using the letters <em>w</em>,
<em>m</em> and <em>s</em> for weak, moderate and strong, as done in the
notes, you would have to define a new label for
<code>effort_g</code>.</p>
<h3 id="adjusted-and-unadjusted-means">Adjusted and Unadjusted
Means</h3>
<p>Let us turn to the comparison of adjusted and unadjusted declines in
Table 2.26, a useful way to present regression results to a
non-technical audience.</p>
<p>We start by restoring the <code>ancova</code> estimates and then
predict fertility decline in each country at its observed level of
effort, but with social setting set to 72.1, which is the sample
mean:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. estimates restore ancova
(results ancova are active now)

. gen adj_change = _b[_cons] + _b[setting] * 72.1 + ///
>   _b[2.effort_g]*(effort_g==2) + _b[3.effort_g]*(effort_g==3)

. label var adj_change "Adjusted change at mean setting"
</pre>
<p>Here we accessed the coefficients from the last regression as
<code>_b[</code><em><code>varname</code></em><code>]</code>, but
<code>_coef[</code><em><code>varname</code></em><code>]</code> also
works. This is better than typing them from the output because it is
less error prone and we don’t lose precision.</p>
<p>Next we tabulate our data by level of effort and summarize observed
and adjusted change. We use the <code>tabstat</code> command instead of
<code>tabulate, summarize</code> as done ealier, because we need summary
statistics for two variables:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. tabstat change adj_change, by(effort_g) statistics(mean)

Summary statistics: Mean
Group variable: effort_g (RECODE of effort (Program Effort))

</pre>
<p>Countries with strong program average a 28% decline in fertility, but
they also tend to have higher settings; we estimate a slightly smaller
decline of about 26% at average social setting. The estimate is based on
the model, which adjusts linearly for setting and assumes that the slope
is the same at all levels of effort. The next step will be to examine
this assumption.</p>
<p>By the way Stata can automate this type of calculation using the
<code>margins</code> command introduced in version 11 (or the
<code>adjust</code> command in earlier versions). We proceeded from
first principles because the calculations are easy to do and you can
understand exactly what is being done.</p>
<p>On the other hand, once you get used to the <code>margins</code>
command you learn to appreciate it’s power. It understands factor
variables, and has the added advantage of producing standard errors of
the adjusted predictions. So here’s how to predict fertility decline by
levels of effort at mean setting:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. margins i.effort_g, at( (mean) setting)

<p>Wasn’t that easy? Having ran the regression using factor variables, I
just asked for the effort margin at mean setting … literally.</p>
<h3 id="the-assumption-of-parallelism">The Assumption of
Parallelism</h3>
<p>We will now allow the linear relationship between change and setting
to vary with level of effort, by introducing an interaction between
setting and the indicators of effort. Before we do that we center the
index of social setting by subtracting the mean, a practice I highly
recommend to simplify the interpretation of “main” effects when the
model has interactions:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. quietly summarize setting

. gen setting_c = setting - r(mean)
</pre>
<p>Here we used the fact that the mean is available as
<code>r(mean)</code> after <code>summarize</code>. (To see all the
results that can be extracted this way type
<code>return list</code>.)</p>
<p>We can now run the regression using <code>#</code> to add an
interaction between centered setting and grouped effort. Note also that
we need to use a <code>c.</code> prefix to clarify that we can to
interact setting as a covariate.</p>

<p>Compare the parameter estimates with Table 2.27 in the notes. You
also have all the information required to produce the hierarchical anova
in Table 2.28.</p>
<p>Because we centered setting, the coefficients for moderate and strong
programs summarize differences by effort at mean setting, rather than at
setting zero (which is well outside the range of the data). Thus,
fertility decline averages 13 percentage points more under strong than
under weak programs in countries with average social setting.</p>
<p>The interaction terms can be used to compute how these differences
vary as we move away from the mean. For example in countries which are
ten points above the mean social setting, the strong versus weak
difference is almost five percentage points more than at the mean. These
differences, however, are not significant, as we can’t reject the
hypothesis that the three slopes are equal.</p>
<pre class='stata'>. testparm c.setting_c#i.effort_g

 ( 1)  2.effort_g#c.setting_c = 0

            Prob > F =    0.6761
</pre>
<p><em>Exercise</em>. Plot the data and the regression lines implied by
the model with an interaction between linear setting and level of
effort. Note how the difference between strong and weak programs
increases with social setting. The interaction is not significant,
however, so we have no evidence that the lines are not in fact
parallel.</p>

<h3 class="first">3.6 Multi-factor Models: Model Selection</h3>
<P>
We now move to an analysis using all three predictors: age, desire for 
no more children, and education. We start by considering models that
treat all variables as factors. Because we have only three variables 
we are able to fit all possible models, which provides a nice check
on the usual forward selection or backward elimination strategies.
<P>
<h4>The Deviance Table</h4>
<P>
Let us reproduce Table 3.13, which compares all possible one, two and
three-factor  models.
I will take advantage of Stata's factor variables to simplify specifying 
these models. 
I will also supress all output to save space, as we are only interested 
in the deviances. 
<P>
(If you are using an earlier version 
of Stata you can try the <code>xi</code> prefix, or build the dummy
variables for the two and three-factor interactions by hand. 
I recommend that you use macros to store the names of the dummies 
corresponding to each interaction term, both for brevity and clarity.)
<P>
The first step will be to fit the model with the three-factor
interaction, which is saturated for the 2x4x2x2 table of
contraceptive use by age, education, and desire for more children.
We will store the log-likelihood and d.f. in two scalars,
and save the fitted values for later plotting 
<pre class='stata'>
. quietly logit cuse i.age##c.nomore##c.educ [fw=n]

. scalar slogL = e(ll)

. scalar sdf = e(df_m)

. predict obs3, xb   // 3-way model
</pre>
<P>
Next we are going to fit 16 different models.
Given the repetitive nature of the calculations it pays to plan in
advance. I will create three variables to store the name, deviance and
d.f. of each model, using a string of up to 36 characters for the
model name
<pre class='stata'>
. gen str36 model = ""
(32 missing values generated)

. gen deviance = .
(32 missing values generated)

. gen df = .
(32 missing values generated)
</pre>
<P>
I will then write a simple command that takes as arguments the
name and specification of the model, fits it, and stores the
name, deviance and d.f. in the three variables just defined,
using a global macro <code>n</code> to keep track of the 
number of the row where the results will be stored
<pre class='stata'>
. program define mfit
  1.         version 11
  2.         args model formula
  3.         quietly logit cuse `formula' [fw=n]
  4.         global n = $n + 1
  5.         quietly replace model = "`model'" in $n
  6.         quietly replace deviance = 2*(slogL-e(ll)) in $n
  7.         quietly replace df = sdf - e(df_m) in $n
  8. end
</pre>
<P>
Finally I initialize the row number to 0 and fit the models,
taking care to enclose the model name and formula in quotes 
to ensure that they are treated as just two arguments rather 
than split into words
<pre class='stata'>
. global n = 0

. // one-factor models
. mfit Age i.age

. mfit Education educ

. mfit "NoMore" nomore

. // two-factor additive models

. // three interactions
. mfit "Age*Educ+Age*NoMore+Educ*NoMore" "i.age##c.nomore c.educ i.age#c.educ c
> .educ#c.nomore"
</pre>
<P>
Done, let's print the results, using only two decimal places for the 
deviances
<pre class='stata'>
. format deviance %6.2f

<P>
Please refer to the notes for various tests based on these models.
You should be able to test for net effects of each factor given the 
other two, test each of the interactions, and test the goodness of 
fit of each model. We now examine three models of interest.
<P>
<h4>The Three-factor Additive Model</h4>
<P>
We will fit again the three-factor additive model so we can show
the parameter estimates reflecting the net effect of each factor.
The gross effects of age and desire or no more children have been
shown earlier in this log. I continue to use factor variables

<P>
Contraceptive use differs by each of these factors, even when we
compare women who fall in the same categories of the other two.
For example the odds of using contraception are  38% higher among
women with some education than among women with no education 
in the same age group and category of desire for more children.
<P>
The deviance of 29.92 on 10 d.f. tells us that this model does not
fit the data, so the assumption that logit differences by one 
variable are the same across categories of the other two is suspect.
<P>
<h4>The Model with One Interaction Effect</h4>
<P>
Of the three models with one interaction term, the one that achieves 
the largest improvement in fit compared to the additive model is the
model with an age by no more interaction, where the difference in
logits between women who want and do not want more children varies
by age. 
<P>
The standard reference-cell parametrization can easily be obtained
using factor variables:

<P>
Make sure you know how to interpret all of these coefficients. For
example the ratio of the odds of using contraception among women who
want no more children relative to those who want more in the same
category of education is 1.07 among women under age 25, but 3.9
times more (giving an odds ratio of 4.1) among women in their forties.
<P>
To aid in interpretation and model criticism we can plot the
observed and fitted logits, effectively reproducing Figure 3.4.
Because we will need more than one plot I will encapsulate the
calculations in a command <code>pof</code>, for <u>p</u>lot
<u>o</u>bserved and <u>f</u>fitted. 
So here's the command:
<pre class='stata'>
. capture program drop pof

. program define pof
  1.         args obs fit more
  2.         twoway ///

>                 5 "more"  6 "no more" 7 "more"  8 "no more") ) `more'
  3. end
</pre>
<P>
The plot combines four scatterplots and four line plots, one for
each subgroup defined by education and desire for more children.
The command takes as arguments the names of variables with the 
observed and fitted value and an optional string to be passed along 
as an option to the graph twoway command. It uses the same
markers as in the notes, but with what I hope is a better legend 
<P>
So here's our first plot
<pre class='stata'>
. predict lfit31, xb

<P>
Note how we can freely mix factor variables for age with hand coded
dummies for the effects of wanting no more children at each age.
We find 34% higher odds of using contraception among women with some
education compared to women with no education in the same age group
and category of desire. We also see that the odds of using contraception
among women who want no more children are higher than among women who
want more children in the same age and category of education,
 7% higher under age 25,  38% higher at age 25-29, three times as high
for women in their thirties and four times as high among women in 
their forties. 
<P>
(In case you are wondering why the coefficients for no more at various 
ages are in positions 6 to 9 rather than 5 to 8, note that When you use 
factor variables Stata stores the coefficient for the reference cell, 
with a value of zero, as part of <code>e(b)</code>.)
<P>
This model passes the conventional goodness of fit test and therefore
provides a reasonable description of contraceptive use by age, 
education, and desire for more children. 
<P>
<h4>All Three Two-Factor Interactions</h4>
<P>
As explained in the notes, there is some evidence that education may 
interact with the other two variables. 
The model with all three two-factor interactions provides the best fit,
with a deviance of 2.44 on three d.f., but is substantially more complex. 
<P>
Rather than present parameter estimates, I will reproduce Figure 3.5, 
which provides some hints on how the model could be simplified.
Thanks to our <code>pof</code> command this is now an easy task:
<P>
<!--

A picture is indeed worth a thousand words. We see that among women
who want no more children contraceptive use increases almost linearly 
with age (in the logit scale) with no differences by education except 
in the oldest age group where use flattens for women with no education. 
Among women who do want more children contraceptive use is generally 
lower, increases more slowly with age, there are some differences by 
education, and these are higher among older women. There's also a hint 
of curvature by age for women with no education who want more children.

<h4>A Parsimonious Model</h4>
<P>
These observations suggest ways to simplify the model. The age
interactions are quite simple: the increase with age is steeper
among women who want no more children, and the difference by education
is larger among women in their forties. Similarly, the educational
difference is larger in use for spacing and among older women. 
<P>
One way to capture these features is to use a quadratic on age,
allow the slope (but not the curvature) to vary by desire for
more children, and introduce effects of education only for 
spacing and after age 40 (and thus not for limiting before age 40). 
To facilitate interpretation of the resulting parameters I center
age around 30: 
<pre class='stata'>
. gen agemc   = agem-30

. gen agemcsq = agemc^2

. gen educ_spacing = educ * (1-nomore)

. gen educ_at40p   = educ * (age==4)
</pre>
<P>
So here is a more parsimonious model

Iteration 4:   log likelihood = -921.89297

<P>
This model has only seven parameters and a deviance of 5.9 on 9 d.f.,
so it is much simpler than the previous model and fits pretty well.
Obviously we can't take the test seriously because we didn't specify
these terms in advance, but the exercise shows how one can simplify 
a model capturing its essential features.  Before we interpret the
coefficients let us check the fitted values
<pre class='stata'>
. predict lfit33, xb

. pof obs3 lfit33 "subtitle(A Simplified Model)"
(note:  named style C not found in class symbol, default attributes used

. graph export fig35b.png, width(500) replace

<P>
We see that the model provides almost the same fit as the much more
complex model of the previous subsection. Returning to the parameter
estimates, we see that contraceptive use generally increases with age, 
with an increment in the odds of about 2.5 percent at age 30 (less at 
younger and older ages, with differences noted below after age 40).
Use is much higher among women who want more children, with an
odds ratio of 2.7 at age 30, increasing about six percent per year 
of age. Women with some education are more likely to use contraception
for spacing purposes, with an odds ratio of 1.5, and are also more
likely to use for either spacing or limiting after age 40, with an 
odds ratio of 2.7 (which makes the odds ratio by education for 
spacers after age 40 just above four).
<P>
Alternative model simplifications are given in the notes.

<h3>3.5. Models with Two Predictors</h3>
<p>
We now turn to logistic regression models with two or more predictors.
For consistency with the notes we will continue to work with grouped
data. This time we will have 8 groups, defined by the combinatios of
four age groups and two categories of desire for more children, as
shown on table 3.7:

There are five basic models of interest for this dataset. I will fit 
fit them all and, when it's all done, reproduce the deviances in
Table 3.8. Let us start with the age model. I'll use <code>glm</code>
throughout to get deviances

<p>
Note that the parameter estimates, standard errors, and model chi-squared 
values are exactly the same as in Section 3.4, when we worked with only 
four binomial observations, showing that grouping the data does not affect 
any of these statistics.
</p>
<p>
The model deviance, however, is different. In Section 3.4 the deviance was 
zero because the model fitted exactly the four groups. Here we work with
eight groups and get a deviance of 66.48. 
</p>
<h4>The Additive Model</h4>
<p>
We are now ready to consider a model with both age and desire for no more 
children:

. estimates store additive
</pre>
<p>
Compare the results with Table 3.9 on page 26 of the notes. Exponentiating the 
coefficient of "nomore" we get an odds ratio of 2.28. This means that the odds 
of using contraception among women who want no more children are double the 
odds among women in the same age group who do want more children. The model 
assumes that the odds ratio is the same for every age group, an assumption we 
will need to test.
</p>
<p>
To test the significance of the odds ratio we can use the Wald test given in 
the output, a z-statistic of 7.04 (which can be squared to obtain a chi-squared 
statistic on one d.f.) The likelihood ratio test would compare the additive 
model with the age model, which we saved just so we could do this test. Here 
are the two tests:
</p>
<pre class='stata'>. test nomore

 ( 1)  [users]nomore = 0

           chi2(  1) =   49.52
         Prob > chi2 =    0.0000

. lrtest ageg .

Likelihood-ratio test                                 LR chi2(1)  =     49.69
(Assumption: ageg nested in additive)                 Prob > chi2 =    0.0000
</pre>
<p>
We obtain chi-squared statistics of 49.5 and 49.7 on one d.f., so there is no 
doubt that the odds of using contraception in any given age group vary by 
whether the women want more children.
</p>
<p>
Make sure you know how to reproduce these results calculating our own dummy
variables.
</p>
<h4>A Model with an Interaction</h4>
<p>
We now add an interaction between age and desire for no more children. 
I will rely once again on factor variables to save work. We use the
doule hash notation to include both main effects and the interaction.
Obviously we need to use the <code>i.</code> prefix for age. If we don't
say anything about "nomore" but include it in an interaction, Stata will
treat it as a factor. I think the output is a bit cleaner is we remind
Stata that it is just a dummy variable y using the <code>c.</code> prefix.
Alternatively, you could create the products of the dummies for the age 
groups and "nomore".

Can you reproduce the Wald test for all terms involving preferences?
</p>
<h4>Reparametrizing Interactions</h4>
<p>
It may be easier to present the result for this model in terms of odds ratios 
by desire for more children in the different age groups, as discussed on 
page 27 of the notes, see also Table 3.10.
</p>
<p>
To this end we need to add a dummy variable for the interaction at age < 25, 
and omit the 'main' effect of wanting no more. This can be done with
factor variables  by specifying the main effect of age and the interaction
but not the main effect of no more.

<p>
The parameters now represent differences in the logit scale between women 
who do not want more children and those who do in each of the four age groups. 
Exponentiating the coefficients (which you can also do with the 
<code>or</code> option) we find that the odds of using contraception for women 
who want no more children, compared to those who do, are 7% higher at age 
under 25, 39% higher at ages 25-29, three times as high at age 30-39, and 
four times as high at age 40-49. The parametrization used here effectively 
combines the 'main' effect of wanting no more children with the 'additional' 
effect as one moves to older age groups in a single number for each age group. 
This leads to a more direct presentation of the results.

The estimated slope shows that the odds of using contraception increase about 
six percent per year of age.

The second model of interest includes additive effects of age and desire for 
no more children, and is analogous to an analysis of covariance model:

<p>
We see that the odds of using contraception are 128% higher among women who 
want no more children than among women who want more and have the same age. 
The estimated difference in log-odds when we adjust linearly for age is very 
similar to that obtained by treating age as a factor (0.826 vs. 0.824).
</p>
<p>
None of these models fits the data very well, so we add an interaction between 
age and desire for no more children. As usual, we center age before 
constructing the interaction

<p>
The estimates agree with the results in Table 3.12. We see that the odds of 
using contraception among women who want more children are about two percent 
higher per year of age. The odds among women who want no more children are 
double those of women who want more at the mean age (30.6). This ratio is 
about five percent higher per year of age above the mean (and of course five 
percent lower per year below the mean).
</p>
<p>
Another way to look at this result is to note that the odds of using 
contraception among women who want no more children are about 7 percent higher 
per year of age. This may be seen more clearly if we parametrize the model 
using two constants and two slopes

<h4>Plotting Observed and Fitted Logits</h4>

Time for a plot. We will reproduce Figure 3.3 in the notes, comparing the 
analysis of covariance model we just fitted, a model with a quadratic effect 
of age where the curvature is assumed to be the same for the two groups 
defined by preferences, and the anova type model which was saturated for the 
age by preferences table and thus represents observed logits.

Visually the model with some curvature provides a better fit, but we have no 
evidence that it is in fact better than the model with two straight lines with 
different slopes.
</p>
<p>
For purposes of presentation you may consider doing an equivalent plot in the 
probability scale. Don't forget that a linear relationship in the logit scale 
will be nonlinear in the probability scale, so you should probably use the 
<code>function</code> or <code>mspline</code> plot types to reflect the 
curvature.

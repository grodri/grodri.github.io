<h2 class='first'>8. Models for Clustered and Panel Data</h2> 
<P> 
We will illustrate the analysis of clustered or panel data using three examples,
two dealing with linear models and with with logits models.
The linear model examples use clustered school data on IQ and language ability, 
and longitudinal state-level data on Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC).

<h3>8.1 Clustered Linear Model</h3>

<P> 
Snijders and Boskers (1999), <i>Multilevel Analysis</i>,
have data for 2287 8-th grade children in 131 schools in
The Netherlands.
The data are available from 
<a href='http://stat.gamma.rug.nl/snijders'>http://stat.gamma.rug.nl/snijders</a>,
follow the link to the ML book. The data are in the file MLBOOK1.DAT,
which includes variable names as well as the data. I split that into
two separate files and made all variable names lowercase.

<h4>OLS</h4>
<p>
We are interested in the relationship between verbal IQ and
the score in a language test.   OLS gives a highly significant
coefficient of 2.65 with a standard error of 0.072:

<h4>Random Effects</h4>
<p>
We consider the fact that the observations are probably correlated
within each school because of unobserved school characteristics
that affect language scores (such as a good language teacher).

<P> 
The coefficient of verbal IQ is 2.49 with a standard error of
0.071 and is still highly significant. We have also learned that
the language scores <i>are</i> correlated within schools, in fact
18.3% of the variation in language scores net of verbal IQ can be
attributed to the       schools (the rest is due to the pupils). The
intra-class correlation is highly significant, as shown by a
test statistic of 225.9 (conservatively a chi-squared with 1 d.f.)
<P> 
<h4>Fixed-Effects (Within)</h4>
<p>
We now consider a fixed-effects model that allows for the possibility
of a correlation between unobserved school characteristics and
verbal IQ (the school with the good teacher attracts brighter students):

<P> 
Our results are very robust, the coefficient of verbal IQ is 2.41
with a standard error of 0.071. We feel pretty confident on our
conclusions. Note that we get an F-test for school effects, which
are highly significant.
<P> 
<h4>Group Means (Between)</h4>
<p>
If you are not deterred by the ecological fallacy you could have
analyzed group means. Stata makes this easy with the <code>be</code> 
option. We also use <code>wls</code> to weight schools in proportion
to the number of students (not that it makes a huge difference):

<P> 
This gives a much larger coefficient of 3.90, albeit with a larger
standard error of 0.334. Clearly working with aggregate data would
overestimate the relationship between verbal IQ and language scores.
Note that the random-effects estimate is between the within and
between estimates (it always is).
<P> 
The following figure (which I did in R because I couldn't figure out how to do
it in Stata without a lot of work) shows the data, separate regression
fits for each of the 131 schools, and the between, within, and
random-effects estimates.
<P> 
<img src="snijders.png" class="img-responsive center-block"/> 
<p>
The red line is the between-groups estimate, which overstates the relationship
between IQ and language scores. The blue line is the within-groups of fixed-effects
estimator. The green line is the random-effects estimator, which is always an
average of the within and between, and in this case comes very close to the
within-groups regressions.

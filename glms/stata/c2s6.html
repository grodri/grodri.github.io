<h2 class="first" id="c2s6">2.6 One-Way Analysis of Variance</h2>
<p>Let us read the data again, and then group social setting into three
categories: &lt; 70, 70-79 and 80+.</p>
<p>First we will make a copy, which I’ll call <code>setting_g</code> for
social setting grouped. (Everyone has their own conventions for naming
variables. I try to keep variable names short, lowercase, and hopefully
not too cryptic. Because we are just starting I will emphasize the ‘not
too cryptic’ part, otherwise I might have used <code>ssg</code>. Stata
allows variable names to have up to 32 characters, but most commands
print only 12, so it is best to stick to a maximum of 12.)</p>
<pre class='stata'>. use https://grodri.github.io/datasets/effort, clear
(Family Planning Effort Data)

. generate setting_g = setting
</pre>
<p>Then we recode it into categories &lt;70, 70-79, and 80+, thus
creating a discrete <em>factor</em> with three levels.</p>
<pre class='stata'>. recode setting_g min/69=1 70/79=2 80/max=3
(20 changes made to setting_g)
</pre>
<p>It might be good idea to label the new variable and its categories. I
will define a new set of labels called <code>setting_g</code> and assign
it to the values of the variable. The names of the variable and the
label don’t have to be the same. For example one could have a label
called <code>yesno</code> assigned to the values of all variables that
take “Yes” and “No” values. In this case it makes sense to use the same
name.</p>
<pre class='stata'>. label var setting_g "Social Setting (Grouped)

. label define setting_g 1 "Low" 2 "Medium" 3 "High"

. label values setting_g setting_g
</pre>
<p>By the way one can shorten this process using options of the
<code>recode</code> command as shown in <a href="c2s7">Section 2.7</a>
in this log, but I think it’s good to see all the steps once.</p>
<p>Let us look at the mean response by level of social setting</p>
<pre class='stata'>. tabulate setting_g, summarize(change)

<p>We observe substantially more fertility decline in countries with
higher setting, but only a small difference between the low and medium
categories.</p>
<h3 id="a-one-factor-model">A One-Factor Model</h3>
<p>Stata has an <code>anova</code> command that can fit linear models
with discrete factors as predictors. We will use <code>regress</code>
instead, to emphasize that all these models are in fact regression
models. This will help us along when we move on to logit and Poisson
models, which no longer make this distinction.</p>
<p>To handle a categorical variable in a regression model we need
indicators for all the categories except one, usually called the
reference cell. Stata 11 introduced <em>factor variables</em>, a
powerful way to specify main effects and interactions in regression
models, and Stata 13 improved the labeling of the results, so there’s
really no need to “roll your own” anymore. For learning purposes,
however, we will show below how you would go about doing that. First,
however, we run the model using <code>i.setting_g</code> to specify that
we want indicator variables for setting grouped. Stata automatically
picks the lowest code as the reference cell.</p>

<p>Fertility declined, on average, 16 percentage points more in
countries with high setting than in countries with low setting. Compare
the parameter estimates with the values in Table 2.11 and the anova with
Table 2.12 in the notes.</p>
<p>You can verify that the constant is the average decline in low
setting countries, and the coefficients for medium and high are the
differences between medium and low, and between high and low; in other
words, differences with respect to the omitted category.</p>
<p>Just for the record, this is how you could get exactly the same
results by creating indicators for medium and high setting:</p>
<pre><code>gen setting_med  = setting_g==2 // or setting &gt;= 70 &amp; setting &lt; 80
gen setting_high = setting_g==3 // or setting &gt;= 80 &amp; !missing(setting)
regress change setting_med setting_high</code></pre>
<p>We could have coded the conditions in terms of the original variable
as shown in the comments above, with exactly the same result. I probably
would have used that approach if the dummies were called
<code>setting70to79</code> and <code>setting80plus</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-f-test">The F-Test</h3>
<p>Stata has a <code>test</code> command that can be used to test one or
more terms in a model. With factor variables you are better off using
the <code>testparm</code> command, which automatically finds the terms
involving a factor. Here’s the F test for the indicators of setting. The
result is, of course, the same as in the anova table: the differences by
setting are significant at the one-percent level.</p>
<pre class='stata'>. testparm i.setting_g

 ( 1)  2.setting_g = 0
 ( 2)  3.setting_g = 0

       F(  2,    17) =    6.97
            Prob > F =    0.0062
</pre>
<p>As the output shows, Stata names the coefficients of a factor
variable using the number of the level followed by a dot and the name of
the factor, as in <code>2.setting_g</code>. You could reproduce this
F-test using the command <code>test 2.setting_g 3.setting_g</code>,
which works fine because these are terms (single variables) in the
model.</p>
<p>On a related matter, Stata stores the coefficients in a matrix called
<code>e(b)</code>, and you can list them using
<code>mat list e(b)</code>. This is how you can find the names of the
coefficients representing factor variables.</p>
<p>The F-test of 6.97 on 2 and 17 d.f. tells us that the differences
between the social setting categories are much larger than one would
expect by chance if all experienced the same decline in fertility.</p>
<p><em>Exercise</em>: Obtain the parameter estimates and anova table for
the model with family planning effort grouped into three categories:
0-4, 5-14 and 15+, labelled weak, moderate and strong.</p>

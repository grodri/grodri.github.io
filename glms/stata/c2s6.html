<h3 class="first">2.6 One-Way Analysis of Variance</h3> 
<P>
Let us group social setting into categories. 
<P>
First we will make a copy, which I'll call <code>setting_g</code> 
for social setting grouped. (Everyone has their own conventions
for naming variables. I try to keep variable names short, lowercase,
and hopefully not too cryptic. 
Because we are just starting I will emphasize the 'not too cryptic' 
part, otherwise I might have used <code>ssg</code>. 
Stata allows variable names to have up to 32 characters, but most 
commands print only 12, so it is best to stick to a maximum of 12.)
<pre class='stata'>
. generate setting_g = setting</pre>
<P>
Then we recode it into categories &lt;70, 70-79, and 80+, thus
creating a discrete <i>factor</i> with three levels.
<pre class='stata'>
. recode setting_g min/69=1 70/79=2 80/max=3
(setting_g: 20 changes made)</pre>
<P>
It might be  good idea to label the new variable and its categories.
I will define a new set of labels called <code>setting_g</code> and 
assign it to the values of the variable. The names of the variable
and the label don't have to be the same. For example one could have
a label called <code>yesno</code> assigned to the values of all
variables that take "Yes" and "No" values. In this case it makes
sense to use the same name.
<pre class='stata'>
. label var setting_g "Social Setting (Grouped)

. label define setting_g 1 "Low" 2 "Medium" 3 "High"

. label values setting_g setting_g</pre>
<P>
By the way one can shorten this process using options of the
<code>recode</code> command as shown in 
<a ref="c2s7.html">Section 2.7</a> in this log,
but I think it's good to see all the steps once.
<P>
Let us look at the mean response by level of social setting
<pre class='stata'>
. tabulate setting_g, summarize(change)

<table class='stata'>
<tr><td class='br'>     Social </td><td class='bl'> Summary of % Change in CBR between </td></tr>

</table></pre>
<P>
We observe substantially more fertility decline in countries with
higher setting, but only a small difference between the low and
medium categories. 
<P>
<h4>Dummy Variables</h4> 
<P>
Stata has an <code>anova</code> command that can fit linear models 
with discrete factors as predictors. 
We will use <code>regress</code> instead, to emphasize that all 
these models are in fact regression models.
This will help us along when we move on to logit and Poisson models,
which no longer make this distinction. 
<P>
This means that we need to code the factor using dummy variables.
This can be done in three different ways:
<P>
<ul> 
<li><p> 
Stata 11 introduced <i>factor variables</i>, a very powerful
way of specifying main effects and interactions in regression models.
This supersedes the <code>xi:</code> prefix that could be used
with commands such as <code>regress</code> in versions 10 and earlier.
This is the simplest and quickest way to proceed. A disadvantage in
versions 11 and 12 is that the results are not labelled, but version
13 fixed that. We'll have an example soon.
</li></p><p><li> 
A second way is to generate the dummies using the <code>gen</code> 
option of the <code>tabulate</code> command. This generates a dummy
or indicator variable for each category of the factor. You specify 
a "stem" or prefix for the names and Stata adds a sequence number.
This makes it very easy to generate dummies called setting_g1, 
setting_g2, etc.
</li></p><p><li>
The most flexible way is to generate the dummies "by hand" using
<code>gen</code>, taking advantage of the fact that in Stata
logical expressions take the value 1 when they are true and 0 when
they are false. This leads to very readable code. Just one word of
caution: you have to be careful with open-ended expressions such as
<code> if x &gt; 100</code> because Stata stores missing values as
very large numbers, so the expression is true if <code>x = 200</code>,
but also true if <code>x</code> is missing. The safe way to code this
condition is <code>if x > 100 & !missing(x)</code>. 
</li></p> 
</ul>
<P>
Let us start with the third way.
To represent a factor with three categories we need only two dummy
variables. I will choose low setting (&lt; 70) as the reference
category and create dummies for medium (70-79) and high (80+):
<pre class='stata'>
. gen setting_med  = setting_g==2 // or setting >= 70 & setting < 80

. gen setting_high = setting_g==3 // or setting >= 80 & !missing(setting)</pre>
<P>
We could have coded the conditions in terms of the original variable
as shown in the comments above, with exactly the same result. 
I probably would have used that approach if the dummies were called
<code>setting70to79</code> and <code>setting80plus</code>. 
<P>
We are now ready to fit the one-factor model:
<pre class='stata'>
. regress change setting_med setting_high

</table></pre>
<P>
Fertility declined, on average, 16 percentage points more in countries 
with high setting than in countries with low setting. 
Can you get these estimates from the means calculated earlier?
Compare the parameter estimates with the values in Table 2.11 and 
the anova with Table 2.12 in the notes.
<P>
The <code>test</code> command can be used to generate the Wald test
on page 32 of the notes. Stata automatically converts the criterion
to an F-test for linear models.  The result is, of course, the same
as in the anova table: the differences by setting are significant
at the one-percent level.
<pre class='stata'>
. test setting_med setting_high

 ( 1)  setting_med = 0
 ( 2)  setting_high = 0

       F(  2,    17) =    6.97
            Prob > F =    0.0062</pre>
<P>
<h4>Factor Variables</h4> 
<p> 
We now show how one to obtain exactly the same results using Stata's 
<i>factor variables</i>. The idea here is to use a <code>i.</code> 
prefix in the list of regressors to tell Stata when a predictor is in 
fact a discrete factor, which takes integer codes such as 0,1,2,...,
and should be treated as a set of dummies rather than a linear effect.
<P>
Stata will then fit the model picking the lowest code as the reference
cell.  You can change the base category using <code>ib#.</code> 
instead of just <code>i.</code> as the prefix, where <code>#</code> 
is the code for the reference category. Thus, <code>i.setting_g</code> 
treats grouped setting as a factor with low as the baseline, whereas
<code>ib3.setting_g</code> sets high as the baseline. 
<P>
Here's the regression with the default reference cell:
<pre class='stata'>
. regress change i.setting_g

</table></pre>
<P>
As you can verify, the results are exactly the same as before. 
If you are using Stata 11 or 12 you pay a small price for this convenience,
namely you have to remember what the codes 2 and 3 stand for. 
Here it is easy because the categories are ordered, 
but things can get trickier with variables such as ethnicity
or type of health care provider. 
If you are using Stata 13, you will see that the categories are labelled
"Medium" and "High", so you get the best of all worlds.
<P>
You can even do the Wald test quite easily, but there is a twist.
You can't write <code>test i.setting_g</code>, which is what I first
tried, because <code>i.setting_g</code> is not a term (or single
variable) in the model. There is, however, an alternative command
called <code>testparm</code> that lets you specify a variable list
and then tests all the corresponding coefficients (read it as 
"test the parameters of ..."). So the solution is
<pre class='stata'>
. testparm i.setting_g

 ( 1)  2.setting_g = 0
 ( 2)  3.setting_g = 0

       F(  2,    17) =    6.97
            Prob > F =    0.0062</pre>
<P>
As the output shows, Stata names the coefficients of a 
factor variable using the number of the level followed by a dot 
and the name of the factor, as in <code>2.setting_g</code>.
You could reproduce this F-test using the command
<code>test 2.setting_g 3.setting_g</code>, which works fine
because these are terms (single variables) in the model.
<P>
On a related matter, Stata stores the coefficients in a matrix
called <code>e(b)</code>, and you can list them using
<code>mat list e(b)</code>. This is how I first discovered 
the names of the coefficients representing factor variables.
<P>
<i>Exercise</i>: Obtain the parameter estimates and anova table
for the model with family planning effort grouped into three
categories: 0-4, 5-14 and 15+, labelled weak, moderate and strong.

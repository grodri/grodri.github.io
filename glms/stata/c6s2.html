<h3 class='first'>6.2 The Multinomial Logit Model</h3> 
<P> 
We start with multinomial logit models treating age as a predictor and
contraceptive use as the outcome.
<P> 
<h4>Age as a Factor</h4> 
<P> 
Obviously the model that treats age as a factor with 7 levels is
saturated for this data.  We can easily obtain the log-likelihood,
and predicted values if we needed them, using factor variables
<pre class='stata'>
. quietly mlogit cuse i.ageg [fw=cases]
 
. estimates store sat
 
. scalar ll_sat = e(ll)
</pre> 
<P> 
<P> 
<h4>Linear and Quadratic Effects</h4> 
<P> 
Following the notes we will consider a model with 
linear and quadratic effects of age. 
To this end we define the midpoints of age and its square. 
For consistency with the notes we will not center age before
computing the square, although I generally recommend that.
We use the <code>baseoutcome()</code> option to define 
'no method' as the baseline or reference outcome:
<pre class='stata'>
. gen age = 12.5 + 5*ageg
 
. gen agesq = age^2
 
. mlogit cuse age agesq [fw=cases], baseoutcome(3)
 
Iteration 0:   log likelihood = -3133.4504  
Iteration 1:   log likelihood = -2892.9822  
Iteration 2:   log likelihood =  -2883.158  
Iteration 3:   log likelihood = -2883.1364  
Iteration 4:   log likelihood = -2883.1364

<P> 
Compare the parameter estimates with Table 6.2 in the notes.
As usual with quadratics it is easier to plot the results,
which we do below. The log-odds of using sterilization rather
than no method increase rapidly with age to reach a maximum
at 36.5. The log-odds of using a method other than sterilization
rather than no method increase slightly to reach a maximum at
age 28.5 and then decline. (The turning points were calculated
by setting the derivatives to zero.)
<P> 
The model chi-square, which as usual compares the current
and null models, indicates that the hypothesis of no age differences
in contraceptive choise is soundly rejected with a chi-squared of
500.6 on 4 d.f. To see where the d.f. come from, note that the current
model has six parameters (two quadratics with three parameters each) 
and the null model of course has only two (the two constants).
<P> 
We don't get a deviance, but Stata does print the log-likelihood.
For individual data the deviance is <i>-2logL</i>, and for the
grouped data in the original table the deviance is twice the
differences in log-likelihoods between the saturated and this model
<pre class='stata'>
. lrtest . sat
 
Likelihood-ratio test                                  LR chi2(8)  =     20.47
(Assumption: . nested in sat)                          Prob > chi2 =    0.0087
</pre> 
<P> 
The deviance of 20.47 on 8 d.f. is significant at the 1% level,
so we have evidence that this model does not fit the data. 
We explore the lack of fit using a graph.
<P> 
<h4>Plotting Observed and Fitted Logits</h4> 
<P> 
Let us do Figure 6.1, comparing observed and fitted logits.
We start with the <code>predict</code> post-estimation command,
which can evaluate logits, with the <code>xb</code> option, or
probabilities, with the <code><u>p</u>r</code> option, the default.
<P> 
If you are predicting probabilities you usually specify one output 
variable for each possible outcome. If you specify just one variable
Stata predicts the first outcome, unless you use  the 
<code>outcome()</code> option to specify which outcome you want
to predict. 
<P> 
If you are predicting logits you <i>must</i> do them one at a
time, so you will usually specify the outcome you want. 
Here we compute the logits for sterilization vs no method and
for other method vs no method:
<pre class='stata'>
. predict fit1, outcome(1) xb
 
. predict fit2, outcome(2) xb
</pre> 
<P> 
For the observed values we could restore the saturated model and
follow the same procedure, but we can also do the calculation
'by hand' taking advantage of the fact that the data are ordered
by contraceptive use within each age group:
<pre class='stata'>
. gen obs1 = log(cases[_n]/cases[_n+2]) if cuse==1
(14 missing values generated)
 
. gen obs2 = log(cases[_n]/cases[_n+1]) if cuse==2
(14 missing values generated)
</pre> 
<P> 
Finally we plot observed versus fitted logits, using markers
for the observed values and smooth curves for the quadratics.
<pre class='stata'>
. graph twoway (scatter obs1 age, mc(green)) ///
>         (scatter obs2 age, mc(red) ms(t)) ///
>         (mspline  fit1 age, bands(7) lc(green) lw(medthick)) ///
>         (mspline  fit2 age,  bands(7) lc(red) lw(medthick) ) ///
>   ,  ytitle("log-odds (no method as base)") ///

</pre> 
<P> 
<img src="fig61.png" class="img-responsive center-block"/> 
<P> 
The graph suggests that most of the lack of fit comes from 
overestimation of the relative odds of being sterilized compared
to using no method at ages 15-19. Adding a dummy for this age
group confirms the result:
<pre class='stata'>
. gen age1519 = ageg==1
 
. quietly mlogit cuse age agesq age1519 [fw=cases]
 
. lrtest . sat
 
Likelihood-ratio test                                  LR chi2(6)  =     12.10
(Assumption: . nested in sat)                          Prob > chi2 =    0.0599
</pre> 
<P> 
The deviance is now only 12.10 on 6 d.f., so we pass the 
goodness of fit test.  (We really didn't need the dummy in the
equation for other methods, so the gain comes from just one d.f.)
<P> 
An important caveat with multinomial logit models is that we
are modeling odds or <i>relative</i> probabilities, and it is
always possible for the odds of one category to increase while
the probability of that category declines, simply because the 
odds of another category increase more. To examine this possibility
one can always compute predicted probabilities.

We pursue these issues at greater length in a discussion of the interpretation 
of multinomial logit coefficients, including the calculation of continuous and 
discrete marginal effects, in <a href="mlogit">an analysis available here</a>.

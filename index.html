<h2> Courses and Tutorials</h2>

<p>You will find here notes, handouts and computing logs for four courses:</p>

<p><a href="glms"><span class="em">Generalized Linear Models</span></a>, 
covering regression models for continuous, binary, count, and survival data, and closing 
with an introduction to models for longitudinal data.</p>

<p><a href="multilevel"><span class="em">Multilevel Models</span></a>,
a half-term course on models for multilevel data, such as data on children, their families,
and the communities where they live, including random intercept and random slope models.</p>

<p><a href="survival"><span class="em">Survival Analysis</span></a>, 
a half-term course on time-to-event or survival data, including parametric models, Cox 
proportional hazard models, competing risks, and frailty models of multivariate survival.</p>

<p><a href="demography"><span class="em">Demographic Methods</span></a>, 
a core course on demographic methods, covering  rates and standardization, life tables, 
nuptiality, fertility rates and birth intervals, tempo effects, population projections, 
and stable populations.</p>

<p>You will also find a pair of introductions to statistical software:</p>

<p><a href="stata"><span class="em">Stata Tutorial</span></a>, a quick overview of a 
popular statistical package with a vast array of up-to-date statistical techniques, and 
excellent facilities for producing publication-quality tables and graphs. Stata is fast, 
easy to use and programable.


<p><a href="r"><span class="em">Introducing R</span></a>, an introduction to R, a 
powerful language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. We provide
tips for getting started, discuss reading and examining data, and then focus on R
as a tool for fitting linear and generalized linear models. </p>

<p>These six sections can always be reached through the navigation bar at the very
top of every page.</p>

<h2> The Computing Logs</h2>

<p>I am a strong believer in reproducible research, and have written a Stata command
called <code>markstat</code> to combine Markdown annotations with Stata code
and output to produce dynamic documents and presentations. </p>

<p>
The command owes its inspiration to <code>rmarkdown</code> from the R world.
The <i>Stata Tutorial</i> was written using <code>markstat</code> and 
<i>Introducing R</i> was written using <code>rmarkdown</code>.</p>

<p>
A nice feature of <code>markstat</code> is that it can include both Stata and R
code. The computing logs for the four courses listed above were written in 
<code>markstat</code>. The GLM course has separate Stata and R versions, while the
other three courses use tabs to view the Stata or R versions. The source code for 
all these scripts is on <a href="https://github.com/grodri/websrc">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The command has its own website at <a href="https://grodri.github.io/markstat">
grodri.github.io/markstat</a></p>

<h2>Biographic Remarks</h2>

<p> I  received my Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the University of 
North Carolina  at Chapel Hill, and before that obtained a Master's degree in Social Science
from the University of Chicago. My undergraduate work in my native Chile was in Psychology, 
where I discovered my love for statistics while studying psychometrics with Erika Himmel. 
A job as a statistical assistant to Anibal Faundes in a fertility survey led to a life-long interest 
in population.</p>

<p>
After graduation I worked for seven years at the World Fertility Survey (WFS) in London, England, 
once described as the largest social science project ever undertaken. I then spent five years in the 
Statistics Department at the Universidad Católica de Chile. In 1987 I joined the Office of Population 
Research at Princeton University, where I worked for thirty two years, transitioning to emeritus status 
in 2019. I have been lucky to interact with wonderful colleagues in all three institutions.</p>

<p>
More extensive biographic remarks may be found in a 
<a href="https://www.populationassociation.org/support/honored-members/german-rodriguez">nice write-up</a>
 by a very kind colleague, who  wrote them as part of the Population Association of America (PAA) 
"honor a colleague" fund-raiser.</p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<p>My main research interest has been statistical demography, the application of statistical 
modeling techniques to the study of human population, with emphasis on fertility and health.</p>

<p>My more technical work focused on multilevel models. A list of my publications in this area 
can be found in the <a href="/research">research</a> section here, including work on assessing 
estimation procedures in multilevel models for binary data, and a chapter in the <i>Handbook of 
Multilevel Analysis</i> edited by Jan de Leeuw and Erik Meijer. More recently I did some work on 
tempo effects in fertility and mortality, noting connections with accelerated failure time models.</p>

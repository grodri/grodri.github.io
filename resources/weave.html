<h2>Weaving Stata Output and Annotations</h2>

<div class="alert alert-warning">The code described here has been superseded by <code>markstat</code>,
a powerful Stata command that can tangle and weave Markdown and Stata code. More information at 
<a href="https://grodri.github.io/markstat">https://grodri.github.io/markstat</a>.</div>
<p>
I am sharing some of the code I use to prepare the Stata logs, hoping you'll
find it useful to combine annotations and Stata code in an approach that I
call <i>Literate Data Analysis</i>, after Donald Knuth's literate programming.
</p><p>
The basic idea is quite simple, you 
(1) prepare a do file that includes Stata code and annotations, 
as explained below,
(2) run it logging the output to a text file, and then 
(3) use the <code>weave</code> command to convert the log to a web page, 
including tables, figures and your comments.
</p><p>
<h4>A Sample Do File</h4>
<p>
Here's a complete example used to read a small dataset and draw
a scatterplot matrix. 
</p>
<pre class="stata">
capture log close
log using sample.usl, text replace
<div class="c">/**
  &lt;h2>Sample Log&lt;/h2>
  
  We read the program effort data from the course website and list the
  first three observations
*/</div>use https://grodri.github.io/datasets/effort
list in 1/3
<div class="c">/**
  Next we draw a scatterplot matrix
*/</div>graph matrix change setting effort
graph export sample.png, width(500) replace
<div class="c">/**
&lt;img class="center" src="sample.png"/>

That's all folks!
*/</div>log close
</pre>
<p>
This file consists of Stata commands and annotations, written in 
special comment blocks that start with /** on a line all by itself,
and end with */, also in a line all by itself. 
This is a standard do file, and will run on any version of Stata, 
without the need for special commands.
</p><p>
When you log the results it is important to use a plain text file rather
than Stata's SMCL format, hence the option <code>text</code>. I often use 
the extension ".usl" for <u>u</u>nformated <u>s</u>tata <u>l</u>og, but you 
can use the default ".log" instead. If you forget to use a text format
you can always translate SMCL to text, type <code>help translate</code>
to learn more.
</p>
<h4>Annotations</h4>
<p>
Annotations are written in HTML, but you don't need to learn more than a
handful of tags. In fact you can produce basic output without knowing any
tags at all, just type plain text using blank lines to indicate paragraph 
breaks. The <code>weave</code> command adds the necessary paragraph tags.
</p><p>
You may also use &lt;h2&gt; and &lt;/h2&gt; tags for headings at level 2, 
or &lt;h4&gt; and &lt;/h4&gt;  for headings at level 4, as I did in the 
example.  Headings must appear on a line by themselves.  The only other tag 
you need to know about is the image tag discussed in the next section.
</p><p>
Technically you should encode the symbol &lt; using <code>&amp;lt;</code> so it is not
mistaken for the start of a tag, but most modern browsers are smart
enough not to be confused. The same applies to the ampersand &amp;, which 
can be encoded as <code>&amp;amp;</code>. The <code>weave</code> command encodes 
these symbols in Stata output, but leaves the annotations alone, otherwise you 
wouldn't be able to use any tags!
</p>
<h4>Figures</h4>
<p>
After you produce a Stata graph, use the <code>graph export</code> command
to export it to a file in PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format. I usually
specify the width as 500 pixels using <code>width(500)</code>, letting Stata 
figure out the height needed to maintain the aspect ratio. 
</p><p>
In the next annotation block, you add HTML code to include the figure.
This is done with the image tag, which has a "src" attribute to specify the
name of the file. I usually add the class="center" attribute to center the image 
on the page, as as shown in the example above. For clarity it is best to put the 
image tag on a line all by itself.
</p>
<h4>Weaving</h4>
<p>
The <code>weave</code> command has the following syntax: 
<code>
weave using <i>filename</i>[, <u>h</u>eader(filename) <u>f</u>ooter(filename)]
</code>.
<p>The <code>using</code> argument is the name of the log file. 
You may omit the extension if it is "usl". 
The optional <code>header</code> and <code>footer</code> are files 
containing bloilerplate html to be included at the beginning and end of the
web page. These files have extension ".html" by default. 
</p><p>
The <code>weave</code>
command comes with default versions of these files, called 
<code>weave_header.html</code> and  <code>weave_footer.html</code>. 
The main job of the default header is to define a few styles to render
the page. The footer closes the body and html tags.
To convert the above log to a web page using the defaults all you need is
</p>
<pre class="stata">
weave using sample
</pre>

<h4>Self-Contained Output</h4>
<p>
Unfortunately the output is not completely self-contained beause the HTML and 
the figures are separate files. There are three solutions to this problem:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Read the HTML file into Word, which does a reasonable job of
parsing the code and including the figures. It has a nasty habit of
adding a blank line at the start of code blocks, but the latest version of 
<code>weave</code> gets around that. (Stata 13 and later can generate Word
documents, but it is a lot easier to read the html.) </p></li>

<li><p>Use my <code>bundle</code> command, which goes through the html
file and each time it finds an image it grabs the file and encodes it
as text using the same format as email attachments (base64). </p></li>

<li><p>Use the Chrome browser, which  can save a web page in PDF format 
(right click, select Print, and under destination select Print to PDF).
Or use Safari on a Mac.  I understand that IE can also do this, but only 
if you have the full version of Adobe Acrobat installed on your PC.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4>Installation</h4>
<p>
There's really no need to install this command, but if you are curious, 
download the zip file
<a href="weavebundle.zip" style="text-decoration:underline">available here</a>
and unzip all the files in your working folder. If you are using a public
computer you may want to keep everything on a USB drive. The zip file
also includes the graph scheme I use in my own logs, called <code>grlog</code>, 
in case you want to use it.

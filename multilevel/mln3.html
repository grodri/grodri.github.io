<h2 class="first" id="mlwin3">A Model With Serial Correlation</h2>
<p>Repeated measurements often exhibit serial correlation, with outcomes
closer it time more highly correlated that outcomes further apart.
Multilevel models have an exchangeable error structure, where all
outcomes in a group are equally correlated, but may be adapted to
accomodate serial correlation.</p>
<p>We will analyze the example in Goldstein (1995, Sections 6.4 and 6.5
starting on page 91) using the MLwiN macros described in Yang et al
(2001) <em>MLwiN Macros for advanced multilevel modelling</em>, which
you may download from <a
href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/software/mlwin/download/macros.html">MLwiN
macros</a>.</p>
<h3 id="a-seasonal-growth-model">A Seasonal Growth Model</h3>
<p>The data are available in a worksheet supplied with MLwiN,
<code>oxboys.ws2</code>, containing height measurements on 26 boys
measured on nine occassions between the ages of 11 and 14. The data have
already been stacked in <em>long</em> format. The variables of interest
are height and age, which is modelled using a fourth-degree polynomial.
Variable <code>occ</code> indicates the occassions and <code>seas</code>
is the month when measures were taken.</p>
<p>If you retrieve the worksheet you will note that it already has
defined the two-level structure and has fitted a simple 2-level model
with a fourth-degree polynomial on age. You may want to type
<code>fixed</code> and <code>random</code> and compare the results with
Yang et al (2001). I will start from scratch to document all steps. Make
sure you use the actual location of MLwiN on your computer.</p>
<pre class="mlwin"><code>retrieve c:\program files\mlwin1.10\oxboys.ws2

setv 2 &quot;cons&quot; &quot;age&quot; &quot;age2&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Note that only the constant, linear and square terms on age are
random at the student level. You may want to fit this model and compare
your results with Yang et al (2001). I will go ahead and add a
seasonality term. As noted in Goldstein (1995, p.92), if the seasonal
component has amplitude a and phase g we can write</p>
<p><em>a cos(t+g) = a<sub>1</sub>cos(t) - a<sub>2</sub>sin(t).</em></p>
<p>For this data the second coefficient is very close to zero and will
be omitted.</p>

<h3 id="adding-serial-correlation">Adding Serial Correlation</h3>
<p>We will now consider a model where level-1 residuals for the same
individual are correlated and the magnitude of the correlation depends
on the time difference between the measurements. Specifically we will
assume that</p>
<p><em>cov(e<sub>t,j</sub>,e<sub>t-s,j</sub>) =
s<sup>2</sup><sub>e</sub> exp{- g s}</em></p>
<p>So the correlation between residuals <em>s</em> time-units apart is
<em>exp{- g s}</em> and decays exponentially with <em>s</em>. (The
correlation between outcomes will also involve level-2 residuals.)</p>
<p>To fit this model make sure you have downloaded the TS macros, and
have adjusted the MLwiN settings to use the right files. As usual I will
provide a script instead of using the GUI. First I define the folder
where the macros are located and the files to be used for pre and post
estimation. The time-series macros require the time variable to be
called T. The other commands are explained in comments:</p>
<pre class="mlwin"><code>note the time variable must be called T
name c2 &quot;T&quot;
note define the location of the pre and post macros
fpath c:\program files\mlwiN1.10\ts
prefile pre.ts
postfile post.ts
note turn on time series switch
set b10 1
note put power in c185 (we use 1)
join c185 1 c185
note put the starting value in c201 (we use 20)
join c201 20 c201
note turn off switches for other models
set b11 0
set b12 0
set b13 0
note set maximum number of iterations to 50
maxi 50</code></pre>
<p>At this stage I fitted the model interactively by pressing the Start
button. The procedure did four iterations. The results are not all shown
in the Equation window, so you have to use <code>random</code> to look
at the random parameters. To ensure that <code>s1</code> has converged
press More and use <code>random</code> a couple of times.</p>
<p>Here are my results, in general agreement with Table 6.5 in Goldstein
(1995, p.Â 93).</p>

<p>The interesting parameter is 6.908. To see what this implies in terms
of serial correlation we compute <em>exp{- g s}</em> for S=0.25, 0.50,
0.75 and 1, which corresponds to observations 3, 6, 9 and 12 months
apart:</p>
<pre class="mlwin"><code>join c50 .25 .5 .75 1 c50
calc c51 = expo(-6.908 * c50)

<p>The result is</p>

<p>We see that the correlation is 0.18 for residuals three months apart,
and declines to 0.03 for residuals six months apart.</p>

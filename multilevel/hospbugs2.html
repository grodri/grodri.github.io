<h2 class="first" id="WinBUGS2">Running WinBUGS in Batch Mode</h2>
<p>Pointing and clicking following the instructions in a compound
document such as <a href="hospBUGS">hospBUGS</a> is fine for becoming
familiar with the software, but for serious work you will want to create
a script that documents all the steps. That’s our task here.</p>
<p>It is possible to run WinBUGS from Stata or from R, and then import
the results for further analysis. Here I’ll focus on running WinBUGS
directly. See Thompson et al. (2006) for Stata, and Sturtz, Ligges and
Gelman (2005) for R.</p>
<div style="border-left:2px solid #3366cc; padding-left:1em">
<p><em>Note</em>. WinBUGS works with local files. You may want to start
by downloading <code>hospital.dat</code>, <code>hospModel.txt</code>,
<code>hospList.txt</code>, <code>hospInits.txt</code>, and
<code>hospScript.txt</code>. The code below assumes that these files are
in <code>d:\temp</code>, but you will need to change that.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="model-and-data-files">Model and Data Files</h4>
<p>We start by saving the model into a text file. For the hospital data
I created <code>hospModel.txt</code>, with the following contents.</p>
<pre><code>model {
    # N observations
    for (i in 1:N) {
        hospital[i] ~ dbern(p[i])
        logit(p[i]) &lt;- bcons + bloginc*loginc[i] + bdistance*distance[i] + 
            bdropout*dropout[i] + bcollege*college[i] + u[group[i]] 
    }
    # M groups
    for (j in 1:M) {
        u[j] ~ dnorm(0,tau)
    }
    # Priors
    bcons     ~ dnorm(0.0,1.0E-6)
    bloginc   ~ dnorm(0.0,1.0E-6)
    bdistance ~ dnorm(0.0,1.0E-6)
    bdropout  ~ dnorm(0.0,1.0E-6)
    bcollege  ~ dnorm(0.0,1.0E-6)
    # Hyperprior
    tau ~ dgamma(0.001,0.001)
}</code></pre>
<p>Next I saved the list with the number of units per level in a file
called <code>hospList.txt</code> which looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>list(N=1060,M=501)</code></pre>
<p>The data themselves, of course, are already in a file called
<code>hospital.txt</code>. Click <a href="hospital.txt">here</a> to see
it.</p>
<p>At this point we add a file with the initial values, which I called
<code>hospInits.txt</code> and which looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>list(bcons=-2.69517150,bloginc=0.45852520,bdistance=-0.07627492,
    bdropout=-1.57007674,bcollege=0.82072827,tau=1)</code></pre>
<h4 id="the-script-file">The Script File</h4>
<p>Wih these four files, all we need is the following script, which I
saved in a file called <code>hospScript.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>display(&#39;log&#39;)
check(&#39;d:/temp/hospModel.txt&#39;)
data(&#39;d:/temp/hospList.txt&#39;)
data(&#39;d:/temp/hospital.txt&#39;)
compile(1)
inits(1,&#39;d:/temp/hospInits.txt&#39;)
gen.inits()
update(500)
set(bcons)
set(bloginc)
set(bdistance)
set(bdropout)
set(bcollege)
set(tau)
update(5000)
coda(*,&#39;d:/temp/hospOut&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Each of the commands listed above corresponds to one of the actions
we performed before: checking the model, reading the data, compiling,
reading initial values for the parameters, generating initial values for
the random effects, running a burn-in, setting the nodes to be traced,
updating, and finally writing the output to a file for further
analysis.</p>
<p>Note that all file names are specified to WinBUGS using forwards
slashes, although the path separator in Windows is a backslash. That’s
why we write <code>d:/temp</code> rather than <code>d:\temp</code>.</p>
<p>You can open the script file in WinBUGS (make sure you say it is of
type “text” before you open it) and then select Model | Script in the
menu or press Alt-M-C, or even better, on Windows press Start and type
cmd in the search box to open a command window, and then type</p>
<p><code>D:\WinBUGS\WinBUGS14.exe /PAR d:/temp/hospScript.txt</code></p>
<p>Make sure you type the path and name of the WinBUGS executable in
your system (I installed my copy in a folder called
<code>D:\WinBUGS</code>. The executable itself is called
<code>WinBUGS14.exe</code>) and the name of the script file.</p>
<h4 id="the-coda-output">The CODA Output</h4>
<p>CODA is a popular program for convergence diagnostics written for R.
WinBUGS produces output that can be read by CODA in a simple format. The
command <code>coda(*,'d:/temp/hospOut')</code> in our script generates
two files: an index and a data file.</p>
<p>The <em>index</em> file has a name consisting of the stem we
specified and the postfix “Index.txt”, so in our case the file is called
“D:\temp\hospOutIndex.txt” and looks like this</p>
<pre><code>bcons     1        5000
bloginc   5001    10000
bdistance 10001   15000
bdropout  15001   20000
bcollege  20001   25000
tau      25001   30000</code></pre>
<p>The <em>data</em> file has a name consisting of the stem we specified
and the postfix “1.txt” where 1 stands for chain 1, so in our case the
file is called “D:\temp\hospOut1.txt” and looks like this (I show only
the first two lines and the last one)</p>
<pre><code>501     -3.038
502     -2.795
...
5500    0.7913</code></pre>
<p>This file simply has the sample number and the value of the parameter
for each draw, in the order specified in the index file. In our case
lines 1 to 5000 are the values of <code>bcons</code>, lines 5001 to
10000 are the values of <code>bloginc</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>Obviously reading this file into Stata or R for further analysis is
not hard.</p>

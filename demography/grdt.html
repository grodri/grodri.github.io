<h2 id="growth-rates-and-doubling-time">Growth Rates and Doubling
Time</h2>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau has population counts for the U.S. from 1790
to 2010. I got the counts up to 2000 from Table 4 in <a
href="https://www.census.gov/population/censusdata/table-4.pdf">this
Census Report</a> (Table 2 had slightly different counts for 1830 and
1940), and added the 2010 count from Wikipedia.</p>
<p>These data are in an ascii file called
<code>uspop1790to2010.dat</code> in the datasets section of this
website. The file has two columns representing year and population. The
first task is to read the data.</p>

<h2 id="growth-rates">Growth Rates</h2>
<p>What was the growth rate in the last intercensal period? Let us list
the population counts for the last two censuses. <span class="stata">We
specify a format so Stata doesn’t list large numbers using scientific
notation; %14.0fc tells Stata to use up to 14 digits with no decimal,
using a comma to indicate thousands.</span></p>
<pre class='stata'>. format pop  %14.0fc

</pre>
<p>So the U.S. population grew by 27,323,632 between 2000 and 2010.
Verify that in the previous intercensal period it grew by
32,712,048.</p>
<p>If we divide the population increase by the population at the start
of the intercensal period, or just take the ratio and subtract one, we
obtain</p>
<pre class='stata'>. scalar ratio = pop[_N]/pop[_N-1]

. di ratio - 1

</pre>
<p>So the population grew by 9.7% in ten years. You’d think this is
0.97% per year, but that is only approximate because it doesn’t compound
the growth over the ten years. If we start with a population <em>P1</em>
and compound <em>k</em> times per year at an annual rate <em>r</em> for
ten years, the population will grow to <em>P<sub>2</sub> =
P<sub>1</sub>(1+r/k)<sup>(10k)</sup>#. Solving for </em>r* gives a
growth rate of <em>r =
k[(P<sub>2</sub>/P<sub>1</sub>)<sup>(1/(10k))</sup>-1]</em>. Here’s the
rate we obtain using different values of <em>k</em></p>

<p>A unit value of <em>k</em> means compounding anually, 12 means
monthly, and 365 means daily. We could continue compounding every
minute, or every second, but you can see that our calculation is quickly
approaching a limit. From elementary calculus we know that as <em>k our
equation becomes </em>P<sub>2</sub> = P<sub>1</sub> <em>exp</em>(10
r)<em>, and solving for </em>r* gives
log<em>(P<sub>2</sub>/P<sub>1</sub>)/10</em>, so the limiting value
is</p>

<p>This is a <em>mean annualized rate of growth</em>. Note that by the
time we compounded every two months we already had the correct value to
five decimal places.</p>
<h3 id="growing-more-slowly">Growing More Slowly</h3>
<p>We can now compute the growth rate for the entire (census) history of
the U.S. We treat all censuses as ten years apart, although this is not
exactly true: over time the census has moved from August to June, and
then April (except for 1920, which was done in January). If you want to
do a more precise calculation, the dates needed are in the reference
given at the top.</p>

</pre>
<p><span class="stata">Note the use of <code>_n-1</code> to refer to the
previous value, generating a missing value for the first row</span></p>
<p>Now we plot the rates over time. Because the growth rate pertains to
the period between two censuses, it makes sense to plot against the
mid-points of the census years, excluding the last</p>
<pre class='stata'>. gen midcensus = (year + year[_n-1])/2

</pre>
<p>The graph is shown further below, combined with a plot of doubling
time. We see that the growth rate was around 3% for about half the 19th
century, declined steadily for almost 100 years with a pre-war dip,
rebounded with the post-war baby boom, and then resumed its decline.</p>

<p>The U.S. population was doubling every 22-24 years in the first half
of the 19th century, but the doubling time has increased steadily
(except for a pre-war spike) and it now takes 75 years to double. Verify
that in the previous intercensal period the growth rate was 0.0124 and
the doubling time was 56 years.</p>

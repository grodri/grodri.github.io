<h2 id="life-table-analysis-of-contraceptive-use">Life Table Analysis of
Contraceptive Use</h2>
<p>We will illustrate the application of increment-decrement life tables
to the analysis of contraceptive effectiveness using a classic dataset
from Tietze (1967), Intra-Uterine Contraception: Recommended Procedures
for Data Analysis. <em>Studies in Family Planning</em> Vol 1, No 18,
Supplement, pp 1-6.</p>
<p>Women will enter the life table with the insertion of an IUD, which
defines a segment of use. The segment ends with an event or
“termination” or “continues” as of the analysis date. Some events
(pregnancy) close the case and are called “closures”, but others (first
expulsion) terminate the segment but not necessarily the case, as the
device may be “reinserted”, in which case the woman re-enters the table
with a new segment of use.</p>
<p>The data come in two tables, one showing first insertions per
calendar month, and another giving details of terminations and
reinsertions.
<!-- Both tables are available in the datasets section of the course website as
`TietzeInsertions.dat` and `TietzeTerminations.dat`. --> I did some
preliminary work to put the data in a more usable form. The
manipulations are simple but tedious. The end result is a file
tabulating insertions, reinsertions, terminations, closures and
continuations by ordinal month. The file is called
<code>tietze.dta</code> and is available in the datasets section in
Stata format.</p>
<p>The variables include the ordinal <code>month</code>, counts of
insertions and reinsertions (<code>ins</code> and <code>reins</code>),
terminations by accidental pregnancy (<code>ap</code>), first and later
expulsion (<code>fe</code>,<code>le</code>), removal for medical or
personal reasons or by investigator’s choice (<code>rm</code>,
<code>rp</code>, <code>ric</code>), and lost to follow up
(<code>lfu</code>), as well as counts of closures by the same reasons
(with names that add a <code>c</code> prefix, so <code>cfe</code> are
closures due to first expulsions.</p>

{% include srtabs.html %}

<p>We start by reading the file and listing some of the counts.</p>

<p>We have a total of 250 first insertions. In the first month there are
7 reinsertions, 25 terminations of various kinds, and 18 continuing
segments.</p>
<h3 id="woman-months-of-use">Woman-Months of Use</h3>
<p>The first task is to compute woman-months of exposure in each month.
We will follow Tietze in assuming that events are uniformly distributed
within each month of use. In the first month we have 250 segments at the
start and 250 + 7 - 25 - 18 = 214 at the end, and exposure is simply the
average, 232 woman-months.</p>

<h3 id="continuation-rates">Continuation “Rates”</h3>
<p>We will compute continuation probabilities using all “relevant”
closures, defined as pregnancy, first and later expulsion, and removal
for medical or personal reasons. We are used to computing rates and then
converting to probabilities (see formula 3.2 in the textbook), but we
can also compute the probability directly using as denominator an
adjusted number at the start of each month obtained by adding half the
relevant closures to the exposure.</p>
<p>It is easy to verify that the two approaches given exactly the same
answer. For example in the first month we have 12 relevant closures.
Dividing by the 232 woman-months of exposure we obtain a rate of 0.0517
which converts to a probability of 0.0504 (using formula 3.12 in the
text: <em>q = 2 m/(2 + m)</em>). Or we can divide 12 by the adjusted
denominator of 232 + 12/2 = 238 to obtain 0.0504 directly.</p>
<p>Once we have the probability of discontinuation in each month we
obtain the probability of continuation as the complement, and the
cumulative continuation probability (unfortunately often called
cumulative continuation “rate”) as a cumulative product</p>

<p>The probability of accidental pregnancy in the first year of use is
4.4%. Try computing similar probabilities for the other relevant
closures. You should get 4.3% for first expulsions, 3.6% for later
expulsions, 6.7% for medical reasons and 4.3% for personal reasons.
These add up to 23.3%, which is of course the complement of the
probability of continuing use after 12 months.</p>
<p>These “rates” can also be computed for events other than closures
using exactly the same procedure. Here is the probability of a first
expulsion in the presence of the other risks:</p>

<p>We get a 15.7% probability of first expulsion in the first year of
use. (Recall that first expulsions are not “fatal”, as the IUD can be
reinserted.) Try computing similar rates for later expulsions and
removals for medical and personal reasons. You should get 6.1%, 8.3% and
4.3% respectively. For pregnancies the answer is the same as above
because every termination is a closure.</p>
<h3 id="gross-rates-of-events">Gross Rates of Events</h3>
<p>We can also compute the equivalent of an associated single-decrement
life table under the assumption of independence of risks. The results
are often called “gross” rates. The calculation proceeds as before but
we use a new adjusted denominator, which adds to the woman-months of
exposure half the events of interest (as opposed to half of all relevant
closures). Let us do the calculation for pregnancies</p>

<p>The probability of accidental pregnancy would be a bit higher, 5%, in
the absence of the other risks. The calculation is based on the
assumption of independence of risks, as the observed probabilities of
pregnancy are applied to women who discontinued for other reasons.</p>
<p>Note that the demographic literature uses “net” for rates in the
presence of other risks and “gross” for rates in the absence of other
risks. The statistical literature reverses the usage.</p>

Toivonen and E. Arjas (1998), Analysis of Contraceptive Failure Data in
Intrauterine Device Studies, <em>Contraception</em>, 58:361-374.</p>

    {hi:Decomposition of a Difference Between Two Rates}

{title:Syntax}

{p 8 17 2}
{cmd: ddrate} {it:expo1 events1 expo2 events2} [, {opt n:ames(name1 name2)} {opt r:ates}]

{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ddrate} decomposes a difference between two crude rates into
additive components due to differences in age composition and 
differences in age-specific rates, where age is just an example of
a possible stratification variable.

{pstd}
The arguments to the command are the names of four variables representing 
exposure (for example mid-year population)
and 
number of events (for example deaths) 
in that order,in each of two populations.

{pstd}
The results include the {it:crude rates}, 
computed by combining each population's composition with its own rates; 
rates that reflect {it:compositional effects}, 
computed using each population's composition with the average rates; 
and {it:standardized rates}, 
computed using each population's rates with the average composition.

{title:Options}

{pstd}
{opt n:ames(name1 name2)} lets you specify 
labels for the two populations. The default is to number them 1 and 2.

{pstd}
{opt r:ates} tells the command that the input is in the form of
stratum-specific rates and proportions in each stratum

    {hi:Myers' Blended Index of Digit Preference}

{title:Syntax}

{p 8 17 2}
{cmd: myers} {varname} {weight} {ifin} [,{opt r:ange(bot top)} {opt m:onths} {opt g:enerate(newvarname)}]

{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:myers} computes Myers' digit preference index, a classical 
measure of age heaping. 
One could just tabulate the last digit of age and see if the
distribution is uniform, 
but population counts show sharp declines with age.

{pstd}
Myers adjusts by tabulating the last digit ten times
with different starting values. 
For example one could work with ages 0-89, 1-90, 2-91, ..., 9-98 
and sum the frequencies to obtain a "blended" population.

{pstd}
In the absence of digit preference one would expect 10% in
each terminal digit. Myers's index is half the sum of absolute
deviations from 10%. Division by two is done so the index
represents the proportion of cases that would need to be
reclassified to obtain a uniform distribution.

{title:Arguments}

{phang}
{varname} is a required argument specifying the variable
of interest, for example age.

{phang}
{weight} is an optional specification of frequency weights,
which is useful if you are computing the index from aggregate
data.

{phang}
{ifin} can be used to restrict computation to a subset of the
data.

{title:Options}

{phang}
{opt r:ange(bot top)} specifies the (initial) range of values to be used. 
For example {opt range(0 89)} will tabulate using ages 0-89 to 9-98.
The range should always span a multiple of 10 (or 12); 
it is an error to specify {opt range(0 90)} because that would include 
the digit 0 eleven times and all others ten. 
The range should always stop (at least) 9 years (or 11 months) short of the 
maximum observed value. 
If this is not the case the command does the calculations as if the
frequencies beyond the observed range were 0 (assuming, for example,
that there are no people over 99) and prints a warning.

{phang}
{opt m:onths} specifies that the data are in months, so interest lies in
multiples of twelve, such as 12, 24, and 36 and the "last digit" (in a
slight abuse of language) is the remainder after dividing by 12, 
so 0 indicates an exact multiple of 12.

{phang}
{opt g:enerate(newvarname)} allows saving the weights used to calculate the
index, which are the product of the user-specified weights (if any) and what
we call the Myers weight, which counts how many times an observation goes
into the index.

{title:Example}

{pstd}
These commands reproduce the results in Siegel and Siegel (page 139),
using data from the Philippines.
The published results treat all counts above age 99 as zero.

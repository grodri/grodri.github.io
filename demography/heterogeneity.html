<h2 id="unobserved-heterogeneity">Unobserved Heterogeneity</h2>
<p>I will use the U.S. life tables for white and black males in 2002 to
illustrate some calculations on unobserved heterogeneity. Please note
that these are period life tables and therefore all calculations apply
to hypothetical cohorts subject to then current age-specific mortality
rates. Serious work on the mortality crossover would look at cohort, not
period, life tables. All I do here is illustrate how individual and
population hazards can differ, and how unobserved heterogeneity can
produce an apparent crossover.</p>

<p>File <code>usWhiteBlackMales2002.dat</code> has side-by-side data for
white and black males, specifically <code>age</code>, and the
<code>lx</code> columns for the two ethnic groups.</p>

<p>I compute the cumulative hazard as negative log survival. I then
difference to compute the average hazard in each single year of age
except the last. Because the hazard applies to a one-year interval I
compute age midpoints by adding 0.5.</p>

<p>We see that the hazard in 2002 was higher for blacks at every age up
to 87, but then the curves cross over.</p>
<h3 id="individual-and-population-hazards">Individual and Population
Hazards</h3>
<p>Consider a hypothetical cohort with individual baseline hazard <span
class="math"><em>h</em><sub>0</sub>(<em>t</em>)</span> and unobserved
heterogeneity, assumed to have a gamma distribution with variance one.
What would this hazard have to look like to produce a population hazard
of <span class="math"><em>h</em>(<em>t</em>)</span>? We saw in the
heterogeneity handout that <span
class="math"><em>h</em><sub>0</sub>(<em>t</em>) =
<em>h</em>(<em>t</em>)<em>exp</em>{<em>H</em>(<em>t</em>)}</span>, see
Equation 5 on page 10. We now apply this formula separately to blacks
and whites.</p>
<p>Before we do, note that in the data the hazard applies to midpoints
whereas the cumulative hazard applies to the lower bounds of each year
of age. For consistency I estimate the cumulative hazard at the midpoint
by averaging the two extremes. This makes very little difference in the
calculations.</p>
<pre class='stata'>. gen h0w = hw * exp( (Hw+Hw[_n+1])/2 )
(1 missing value generated)

. gen h0b = hb * exp( (Hb+Hb[_n+1])/2 )
(1 missing value generated)
</pre>

<p>The next pair of graphs compares individual and population hazards
for each ethnic group:</p>

<pre class='r'>> ggplot(us, aes(age, log(h0))) + geom_line() +

</pre>
<p><img src="uswbmhh0r.png" class="img-responsive img-center r" /></p>
<p>We see how, for each ethnic group, the subject-specific hazard rises
with age more steeply than the population-average hazard. The difference
is larger for blacks because mortality is higher. If we had used cohort
rates the difference would be more noticeable because mortality used to
be higher at younger ages.</p>
<h3 id="individual-hazards-and-the-cross-over">Individual Hazards and
the Cross-over</h3>
<p>The final graph compares white and black males using the estimated
individual-level baseline hazards:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. line h0w h0b agem, yscale(log) ytitle(hazard) xtitle(age) ///
>   title(Individual Hazards) subtitle(U.S. Males 2002) ///

> ggsave("uswbmh0r.png", width=500/72, height=400/72, dpi=72)    
</pre>
<p><img src="uswbmh0r.png" class="img-responsive img-center r" /></p>
<p>We see that the cross-over has practically dissappeared, the baseline
hazard is higher for whites only after age 98. Increasing the variance
of frailty a little would erase that too.</p>

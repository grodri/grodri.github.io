<h2 id="smoothing-splines">Smoothing: Splines</h2>
<p>This continues our work on smoothing. Let's start by making sure we
have loaded the data.</p>

{% include srtabs.html %}

<pre class='stata'>. infile age pop using ///

(99 observations read)

<p>Our application will focus on regression splines, because they are
the easiest ones to use, but we will mention briefly natural regression
splines and smoothing splines.</p>
<h3 id="regression-splines">Regression Splines</h3>
<p>A cubic spline <em>S(x)</em> with knots <em>t<sub>1</sub> …
t<sub>k</sub></em> has linear, quadratic and cubic terms on <em>x</em>,
and one term of the form <em>(x -
t<sub>1</sub>)<sup>3</sup><sub>+</sub></em> for each knot. The
<em>+</em> notation instructs us to take the positive part of the
argument. These terms are easy to compute and can be entered as
predictors in a regression, although one should be careful about
multi-collinearity when there are lots of knots.</p>
<p>A better solution is to use <em>b-splines</em>, a well-conditioned
basis for splines. <span class="stata">Stata does not have built-in
b-splines, but Roger Newson has contributed a command called
<code>bspline</code>.</span><span class="r">R has a function
<code>bs()</code> included in the <code>splines</code> package as part
of the base installation.</span>The Stata and R implementations use
somewhat different bases, but lead to the same fitted values.</p>
<p>Let us use spline regression to smooth the Colombian data. We will
use a cubic spline with three internal knots at ages 25, 50 and 75. This
spline has a total of 7 parameters. <span class="stata">In
<code>bspline</code> you need to specify the minimum and maximum as
knots. You should also</span><span class="stata">specify
<code>p(3)</code> to get cubic splines (the default is linear) and seven
output variables.</span><span class="r">In R the spline basis may be
specified as part of the model.</span></p>
<pre class='stata'>. bspline, xvar(age) knots(0 25 50 75 100) p(3) gen(_bs3k)
</pre>
<p>We now regress the population counts on the spline basis <span
class="stata">omitting the constant (or one of the generated
variables).</span>I skip the detailed output because we are interested
in the fitted values only.</p>

<p>As you can see, the spline does an excellent job smoothing the data.
Try using four knots at ages 20, 40, 60 and 80. The fit will look very
similar. Placing the knots is an art; a common choice is to place them
at given quantiles, for example the quartiles Q1, Q2 and Q3 if you want
three internal knots. The number of knots is chosen to balance
smoothness and goodness of fit.</p>
<h3 id="the-power-series">The Power Series</h3>
<p>Just to convince yourself that there is nothing magic about
b-splines, we will reproduce the results “by hand” using the power
series as described in the handout</p>

<p>As you can see, we get essentially the same results, a tribute to the
numerical prowess of modern statistical software in the presence of high
multicollineary. In case you are curious the correlation between age and
its square is 0.9676, between age<sup>2</sup> and age<sup>3</sup> is
0.9859, and between age<sup>3</sup> and the first knot is 0.9867. The
terms in the b-spline basis have much lower inter-correlations.</p>
<h3 id="natural-splines">Natural Splines</h3>
<p>Sometimes we have little information at the extremes of the range.
Natural cubic splines, which are constrained to be linear outside the
range of the data, provide a useful tool in those circumstances. Note
that requiring linearity outside the range of the data imposes
additional smoothness constraints inside the range; for example the
polynomials used at the ends must terminate with zero curvature. <span
class="stata">Stata does not have a natural cubic spline function, but
coding one is not too hard.</span><span class="r">R’s function
<code>ns()</code> in the <code>splines</code> package provides a natural
spline basis.</span></p>
<h3 id="smoothing-splines-1">Smoothing Splines</h3>
<p>A smoothing spline has a knot at each data point, but introduces a
penalty for lack of smoothness. If the penalty is zero you get a
function that interpolates the data. If the penalty is infinite you get
a straight line fitted by ordinary least squares. Usually a nice
compromise can be found somewhere in between. We usually focus on
splines of odd degree, particularly on cubic splines which have some
nice properties as noted in the handout.</p>
<p>Stata and R do not have built-in functions for computing smoothing
splines, but it is not too difficult to construct one using the results
on page 7 of the handout.</p>

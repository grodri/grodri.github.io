<h1 class="first" id="s2">2 Data Management</h1>
<p>In this section I describe Stata data files, discuss how to read raw
data into Stata in free and fixed formats, how to create new variables,
how to document a dataset labeling the variables and their values, and
how to manage Stata system files.</p>
<p>Stata 11 introduced a variables manager that allows editing variable
names, labels, types, formats, and notes, as well as value labels, using
an intuitive graphical user interface available under
<u>D</u>ata|<u>V</u>ariables Manager in the menu system. While the
manager is certainly convenient, I still prefer writing all commands in
a do file to ensure research reproducibility. A nice feature of the
manager, however, is that it generates the Stata commands needed to
accomplish the changes, so it can be used as a learning tool and, as
long as you are logging the session, leaves a record behind.</p>
<h2 id="s21">2.1 Stata Files</h2>
<p>Stata datasets are rectangular arrays with <em>n</em> observations on
<em>m</em> variables. Unlike packages that read one observation at a
time, Stata keeps all data in memory, which is one reason why it is so
fast. There’s a limit of 2,047 variables in Stata/BE, 32,767 in
Stata/SE, and 120,000 in Stata/MP. You can have as many observations as
your computer’s memory will allow, provided you don’t go too far above 2
billion cases with Stata/SE and 1 trillion with Stata/MP. (To find these
limits type <code>help limits</code>.)</p>
<h3 id="variable-names">2.1.1 Variable Names</h3>
<p>Variable names can have up to 32 characters, but many commands print
only 12, and shorter names are easier to type. Stata names are <em>case
sensitive</em>, <code>Age</code> and <code>age</code> are different
variables! It pays to develop a convention for naming variables and
sticking to it. I prefer short lowercase names and tend to use single
words or abbreviations rather than multi-word names, for example I
prefer <code>effort</code> or <code>fpe</code> to
<code>family_planning_effort or familyPlanningEffort,</code> although
all four names are legal. Note the use of underscores or camel casing to
separate words.</p>
<h3 id="variable-types">2.1.2 Variable Types</h3>
<p>Variables can contain numbers or strings. Numeric variables can be
stored as integers (bytes, integers, or longs) or floating point (float
or double). These types differ in the range or precision of the values
they can hold, type <code>help datatype</code> for details.</p>
<p>You usually don’t need to be concerned about the storage mode; Stata
does all calculations using doubles, and the <code>compress</code>
command will find the most economical way to store each variable in your
dataset, type <code>help compress</code> to learn more.</p>
<p>You <em>do</em> have to be careful with logical comparisons involving
floating point types. If you store 0.1 in a float called x, you may be
surprised to learn that x == 0.1 is never true. The reason is that 0.1
is “rounded” to different binary numbers when stored as a float (the
variable <code>x</code>) or as a double (the constant 0.1). This problem
does not occur with integers or strings.</p>
<p>String variables can have varying lengths up to 244 characters in
Stata 12, or up to two billion characters in Stata 13 or higher, where
you can use <code>str1...str2045</code> to define fixed-length strings
of up to 2045 characters, and <code>strL</code> to define a long string,
suitable for storing plain text or even binary large objects such as
images or word processing documents, type <code>help strings</code> to
learn more. Strings are ideally suited for id variables because they can
be compared without problems.</p>
<p>Sometimes you may need to convert between numeric and string
variables. If a variable has been read as a string but really contains
numbers you will want to use the command <code>destring</code> or the
function <code>real()</code>. Otherwise, you can use <code>encode</code>
to convert string data into a numeric variable or <code>decode</code> to
convert numeric variables to strings. These commands rely on value
labels, which are described below.</p>
<h3 id="missing-values">2.1.3 Missing Values</h3>
<p>Like other statistical packages, Stata distinguishes <em>missing</em>
values. The basic missing value for numeric variables is represented by
a dot <code>.</code> Starting with version 8 there are 26 additional
missing-value codes denoted by <code>.a</code> to <code>.z</code>. These
values are represented internally as very large numbers, so
<em>valid_numbers</em> <code>&lt; . &lt; .a &lt; ... &lt; .z</code>.</p>
<p>To check for missing you need to write <code>var &gt;= .</code> (not
<code>var == .</code>). Stata has a function that can do this
comparison, <code>missing(varname)</code> and I recommend it because it
leads to more readable code, e.g. I prefer
<code>list id if missing(age)</code> to
<code>list id if age &gt;= .</code></p>
<p>Missing values for string variables are denoted by ““, the empty
string; not to be confused with a string that is all blanks, such as”
“.</p>
<p>Demographic survey data often use codes such as 88 for <em>not
applicable</em> and 99 for <em>not ascertained</em>. For example age at
marriage may be coded 88 for single women and 99 for women who are known
to be married but did not report their age at marriage. You will often
want to distinguish these two cases using different kinds of missing
value codes. If you wanted to recode 88’s to <code>.n</code> (for “na”
or not applicable) and 99’s to <code>.m</code> (for “missing”) you could
use the code</p>
<pre><code>replace ageAtMar = .n if ageAtMar == 88
replace ageAtMar = .m if ageAtMar == 99</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes you want to tabulate a variable including missing values
but excluding not applicable cases. If you will be doing this often you
may prefer to leave 99 as a regular code and define only 88 as missing.
Just be careful if you then run a regression!</p>
<p>Stata ships with a number of small datasets, type
<code>sysuse dir</code> to get a list. You can use any of these by
typing <code>sysuse name</code>. The Stata website is also a repository
for datasets used in the Stata manuals and in a number of statistical
books.</p>
<h2 id="s22">2.2 Reading Data Into Stata</h2>
<p>In this section we discuss how to read <em>raw</em> data files. If
your data come from another statistical package, such as SAS or SPSS,
you will be glad to know that starting with version 16 Stata can
<code>import sas</code> and <code>import spss</code>. Older versions
could read SAS transport or export files, using the command
<code>fdause</code> (so-named because this is the format required by the
Food and Drug Administration), later renamed to
<code>import sasxport</code>. Stata can also import and export Excel
spreadsheets, type <code>help import excel</code> for details, and can
read data from relational databases, type <code>help odbc</code> for an
introduction. For more alternatives consider using a tool such as
Stat/Transfer (<a
href="https://stattransfer.com/">stattransfer.com</a>).</p>
<h3 id="free-format">2.2.1 Free Format</h3>
<p>If your data are in free format, with variables separated by blanks,
commas, or tabs, you can use the <code><u>inf</u>ile</code> command.</p>
<p>For an example of a free format file consider the family planning
effort data available online as <code>effort.raw</code> as shown below.
This is essentially a text file with four columns, one with country
names and three with numeric variables, separated by white space. We can
read the data into Stata using the command</p>
<pre class='stata'>. clear

. infile str14 country setting effort change using ///
>     https://grodri.github.io/datasets/effort.raw
(20 observations read)
</pre>
<p>The <code><u>inf</u>ile</code> command is followed by the names of
the variables. Because the country name is a string rather than a
numeric variable we precede the name with <code>str14</code>, which sets
the type of the variable as a string of up to 14 characters. All other
variables are numeric, which is the default type.</p>
<p>The keyword <code>using</code> is followed by the name of the file,
which can be a file on your computer, a local network, or the internet.
In this example we are reading the file directly off the internet. And
that’s all there is to it. For more information on this command type
<code>help infile1</code>. To see what we got we can <code>list</code> a
few cases</p>
<pre class='stata'>. list in 1/3

     ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
     │ country   setting   effort   change │
     ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
  1. │ Bolivia        46        0        1 │
  2. │  Brazil        74        0       10 │
  3. │   Chile        89       16       29 │
     └─────────────────────────────────────┘
</pre>
<p>Spreadsheet packages such as Excel often export data separated by
tabs or commas, with one observation per line. Sometimes the first line
has the names of the variables. If your data are in this format you can
read them using the <code>import delimited</code> command. This command
superseeded the <code>insheet</code> command as of Stata 13. Type
<code>help import delimited</code> to learn more.</p>
<h3 id="fixed-format">2.2.2 Fixed Format</h3>
<p>Survey data often come in fixed format, with one or more records per
case and each variable in a fixed position in each record.</p>
<p>The simplest way to read fixed-format data is using the
<code>infix</code> command to specify the columns where each variable is
located. As it happens, the effort data are neatly lined up in columns,
so we could read them as follows:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. infix str country 4-17 setting 23-24 effort 31-32 change 40-41 using ///
>     https://grodri.github.io/datasets/effort.raw, clear
(20 observations read)
</pre>
<p>This says to read the <code>country</code> name from columns 4-17,
<code>setting</code> from columns 23-24, and so on. It is, of course,
essential to read the correct columns. We specified that country was a
string variable but didn’t have to specify the width, which was clear
from the fact that the data are in columns 4-17. The <code>clear</code>
option is used to overwrite the existing dataset in memory.</p>
<p>If you have a large number of variables you should consider typing
the names and locations on a separate file, called a
<em>dictionary</em>, which you can then call from the <code>infix</code>
command. Try typing the following dictionary into a file called
<code>effort.dct</code>:</p>
<pre><code>infix dictionary using https://grodri.github.io/datasets/effort.raw {
  str country  4-17
      setting 23-24
      effort  31-32
      change  40-41
}</code></pre>
<p>Dictionaries accept only <code>/* */</code> comments, and these must
appear <em>after</em> the first line. After you save this file you can
read the data using the command</p>
<pre><code>infix using effort.dct, clear</code></pre>
<p>Note that you now ‘use’ the dictionary, which in turn ‘uses’ the data
file. Instead of specifying the name of the data file in the dictionary
you could specify it as an option to the infix command, using the form
<code>infix using dictionaryfile, using(datafile).</code> The first
‘using’ specifies the dictionary and the second ‘using’ is an option
specifying the data file. This is particularly useful if you want to use
one dictionary to read several data files stored in the same format.</p>
<p>If your observations span multiple records or lines, you can still
read them using <code>infix</code> as long as all observations have the
same number of records (not necessarily all of the same width). For more
information see <code>help infix</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>infile</code> command can also be used with fixed-format
data and a dictionary. This is a very powerful command that gives you a
number of options not available with <code>infix</code>; for example it
lets you define variable labels right in the dictionary, but the syntax
is a bit more complicated. See <code>help infile2</code>.</p>
<p>In most cases you will find that you can read free-format data using
<code>infile</code> and fixed-format data using <code>infix</code>. For
more information on various ways to import data into Stata see
<code>help import</code>.</p>
<p>Data can also be typed directly into Stata using the
<code>input</code> command, see <code>help input</code>, or using the
built-in Stata data editor available through <u>D</u>ata|<u>D</u>ata
editor on the menu system.</p>
<h2 id="s23">2.3 Data Documentation</h2>
<p>After you read your data into Stata it is important to prepare some
documentation. In this section we will see how to create labels for your
dataset, the variables, and their values, and how to create notes for
the dataset and the variables.</p>
<h3 id="data-label-and-notes">2.3.1 Data Label and Notes</h3>
<p>Stata lets you label your dataset using the <code>label data</code>
command followed by a label of up to 80 characters. You can also add
notes of up to ~64K characters each using the <code>notes</code> command
followed by a colon and then the text:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. label data "Family Planning Effort Data"

. notes:  Source P.W. Mauldin and B. Berelson (1978). ///
>   Conditions of fertility decline in developing countries, 1965-75. ///
>   Studies in Family Planning, 9:89-147
</pre>
<p>Users of the data can type <code>notes</code> to see your annotation.
Documenting your data carefully always pays off.</p>
<h3 id="variable-labels-and-notes">2.3.2 Variable Labels and Notes</h3>
<p>You can (and should) label your variables using the
<code>label variable</code> command followed by the name of the variable
and a label of up to 80 characters enclosed in quotes. With the
<code>infile</code> command you can add these labels to the dictionary,
which is a natural home for them. Otherwise you should prepare a do file
with all the labels. Here’s how to define labels for the three variables
in our dataset:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. label variable setting "Social Setting"

. label variable effort  "Family Planning Effort"

. label variable change  "Fertility Change"
</pre>
<p>Stata also lets you add notes to specific variables using the command
<code>notes varname: text</code>. Note that the command is followed by a
variable name and <em>then</em> a colon:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. notes change: Percent decline in the crude birth rate (CBR) ///
>   -the number of births per thousand population- between 1965 and 1975.
</pre>
<p>Type <code>describe</code> and then <code>notes</code> to check our
work so far.</p>
<h3 id="value-labels">2.3.3 Value Labels</h3>
<p>You can also label the values of categorical variables. Our dataset
doesn’t have any categorical variables, but let’s create one. We will
make a copy of the family planning effort variable and then group it
into three categories, 0-4, 5-14 and 15+, which represent weak, moderate
and strong programs (the <code>generate</code> and <code>recode</code>
used in the first two lines are described in the next section, where we
also show how to accomplish all these steps with just one command):</p>
<pre class='stata'>. generate effortg = effort 

. recode effortg 0/4=1 5/14=2 15/max=3
(20 changes made to effortg)

. label define effortg 1 "Weak" 2 "Moderate" 3 "Strong", replace

. label values effortg effortg

. label variable effortg "Family Planning Effort (Grouped)"
</pre>
<p>Stata has a two-step approach to defining labels. First you define a
<em>named label set</em> which associates integer codes with labels of
up to 80 characters, using the label define command. Then you associate
the set of labels with a variable, using the <code>label values</code>
command. Often you use the same name for the label set and the variable,
as we did in our example.</p>
<p>One advantage of this approach is that you can use the same set of
labels for several variables. The canonical example is
<code>label define yesno 1 "yes" 0 "no"</code>, which can then be
associated with all 0-1 variables in your dataset, using a command of
the form <code>label values variablename yesno</code> for each one. When
defining labels you can omit the quotes if the label is a single word,
but I prefer to use them always for clarity.</p>
<p>Label sets can be modified using the options <code>add</code> or
<code>modify</code>, listed using <code>label dir</code> (lists only
names) or <code>label list</code> (lists names and labels), and saved to
a do file using <code>label save</code>. Type <code>help label</code> to
learn more about these options and commands. You can also have labels in
different languages as explained below.</p>
<h3 id="multilingual-labels">2.3.4 Multilingual Labels*</h3>
<p>(This sub-section can be skipped without loss of continuity.) A Stata
file can store labels in several languages and you can move freely from
one set to another. One limitation of multi-language support in version
13 and earlier is that labels were restricted to 7-bit ascii characters,
so you couldn’t include letters with diacritical marks such as accents.
This limitation was removed with the introduction of Unicode support in
Stata 14, so you can use diacritical marks and other non-ascii
characters, not just in labels but throughout Stata.</p>
<p>I’ll illustrate the idea by creating Spanish labels for our dataset.
Following Stata recommendations we will use the ISO standard two-letter
language codes, <strong>en</strong> for English and <strong>es</strong>
for Spanish.</p>
<p>First we use <code>label language</code> to rename the current
language to <code>en</code>, and to create a new language set
<code>es</code>:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. label language en, rename
(language default renamed en)

. label language es, new
(language es now current language)
</pre>
<p>If you type <code>desc</code> now you will discover that our
variables have no labels! We could have copied the English ones by using
the option <code>copy</code>, but that wouldn’t save us any work in this
case. Here are Spanish versions of the data and variable labels:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. label data "Datos de Mauldin y Berelson sobre Planificación Familiar"

. label variable country "País"

. label variable setting "Indice de Desarrollo Social"

. label variable effort  "Esfuerzo en Planificación Familiar"

. label variable effortg "Esfuerzo en Planificación Familiar (Agrupado)"

. label variable change  "Cambio en la Tasa Bruta de Natalidad (%)"
</pre>
<p>These definitions do not overwrite the corresponding English labels,
but coexist with them in a parallel Spanish universe. With value labels
you have to be a bit more careful, however; you can’t just redefine the
label set called <code>effortg</code> because it is only the association
between a variable and a set of labels, not the labels themselves, that
is stored in a language set. What you need to do is define a new label
set; we’ll call it <code>effortg_es</code>, combining the old name and
the new language code, and then associate it with the variable
<code>effortg</code>:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. label define effortg_es 1 "Débil" 2 "Moderado" 3 "Fuerte"

. label values effortg effortg_es
</pre>
<p>You may want to try the <code>describe</code> command now. Try
tabulating effort (output not shown).</p>
<pre><code>table effortg</code></pre>
<p>Next we change the language back to English and run the table
again:</p>
<pre><code>label language en
table effortg</code></pre>
<p>For more information type <code>help label_language.</code></p>
<h2 id="s24">2.4 Creating New Variables</h2>
<p>The most important Stata commands for creating new variables are
<code>generate/replace</code> and <code>recode</code>, and they are
often used together.</p>
<h3 id="generate-and-replace">2.4.1 Generate and Replace</h3>
<p>The <code><u>gen</u>erate</code> command creates a new variable using
an expression that may combine constants, variables, functions, and
arithmetic and logical operators. Let’s start with a simple example:
here is how to create setting squared:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. gen settingsq = setting^2.
</pre>
<p>If you are going to use this term in a regression you know that
linear and quadratic terms are highly correlated. It may be a good idea
to center the variable (by subtracting the mean) before squaring it.
Here we run <code>summarize</code> using <code>quietly</code> to
suppress the output and retrieve the mean from the stored result
<code>r(mean)</code>:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. quietly summarize setting

. gen settingcsq = (setting - r(mean))^2
</pre>
<p>Note that I used a different name for this variable. Stata will not
let you overwrite an existing variable using generate. If you really
mean to replace the values of the old variable use <code>replace</code>
instead. You can also use <code>drop var_names</code> to drop one or
more variables from the dataset.</p>
<h3 id="operators-and-expressions">2.4.2 Operators and Expressions</h3>
<p>The following table shows the standard arithmetic, logical and
relational operators you may use in expressions:</p>
<table>

<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Arithmetic</strong></td>

<td style="text-align: left;">+ string concatenation</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">&gt;= greater than or equal</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here’s how to create an indicator variable for countries with
high-effort programs:</p>
<pre><code>generate hieffort1 = effort &gt; 14</code></pre>
<p>This is a common Stata idiom, taking advantage of the fact that
logical expressions take the value 1 if true and 0 if false. A common
alternative is to write</p>
<pre><code>generate hieffort2 = 0
replace  hieffort2 = 1 if effort &gt; 14</code></pre>
<p>The two strategies yield exactly the same answer. Both will be wrong
if there are missing values, which will be coded as high effort because
missing value codes are very large values, as noted in Section 2.1
above. You should develop a good habit of avoiding open ended
comparisons. My preferred approach is to use</p>
<pre><code>generate hieffort = effort &gt; 14 if !missing(effort)</code></pre>
<p>which gives true for effort above 14, false for effort less than or
equal to 14, and missing when effort is missing. Logical expressions may
be combined using &amp; for “and” or | for “or”. Here’s how to create an
indicator variable for effort between 5 and 14:</p>
<pre><code>gen effort5to14 = (effort &gt;=5 &amp; effort &lt;= 14)</code></pre>
<p>Here we don’t need to worry about missing values, they are excluded
by the clause <code>effort &lt;= 14.</code></p>
<h3 id="functions">2.4.3 Functions</h3>
<p>Stata has a large number of functions, here are a few frequently-used
mathematical functions, type <code>help mathfun</code> to see a complete
list:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">abs(x)</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>These functions are automatically applied to all observations when
the argument is a variable in your dataset.</p>
<p>Stata also has a function to generate random numbers (useful in
simulation), namely <code>uniform()</code>. It also has an extensive set
of functions to compute probability distributions (needed for p-values)
and their inverses (needed for critical values), including
<code>normal()</code> for the normal cdf and <code>invnormal()</code>
for its inverse, see <code>help density functions</code> for more
information. To simulate normally distributed observations you can
use</p>
<pre><code>rnormal()   // or invnormal(uniform()) </code></pre>
<p>There are also some specialized functions for working with strings,
see <code>help string functions</code>, and with dates, see
<code>help date functions</code>.</p>
<h3 id="recoding-variables">2.4.4 Recoding Variables</h3>
<p>The <code>recode</code> command is used to group a numeric variable
into categories. Suppose for example a fertility survey has age in
single years for women aged 15 to 49, and you would like to code it into
5-year age groups. You could, of course, use something like</p>
<pre><code>gen age5 = int((age-15)/5)+1 if !missing(age)</code></pre>
<p>but this only works for regularly spaced intervals (and is a bit
cryptic). The same result can be obtained using</p>
<pre><code>recode age (15/19=1) (20/24=2) (25/29=3) (30/34=4) ///
           (35/39=5) (40/44=6) (45/49=7), gen(age5)</code></pre>
<p>Each expression in parenthesis is a recoding rule, and consist of a
list or range of values, followed by an equal sign and a new value. A
range, specified using a slash, includes the two boundaries, so 15/19 is
15 to 19, which could also be specified as 15 16 17 18 19 or even 15 16
17/19. You can use <code>min</code> to refer to the smallest value and
<code>max</code> to refer to the largest value, as in
<code>min/19</code> and <code>44/max</code>. The parentheses may be
omitted when the rule has the form range=value, but they usually help
make the command more readable.</p>
<p>Values are assigned to the first category where they fall. Values
that are never assigned to a category are kept as they are. You can use
<code>else</code> (or *) as the last clause to refer to any value not
yet assigned. Alternatively, you can use <code>missing</code> and
<code>nonmissing</code> to refer to unassigned missing and nonmissing
values; these must be the last two clauses and cannot be combined with
else.</p>
<p>In our example we also used the <code>gen()</code> option to generate
a new variable, in this case <code>age5</code>; the default is to
replace the values of the existing variable. I strongly recommend that
you always use the <code>gen</code> option, or make a copy of the
original variable before recoding it.</p>
<p>You can also specify <em>value labels</em> in each recoding rule.
This is simpler and less error prone that creating the labels in a
separate statement. The option <code>label(label_name)</code> lets you
assign a name to the labels created (the default is the same as the
variable name). Here’s an example showing how to recode and label family
planning effort in one step (compare with the four commands used in
Section 2.4.2 above).</p>
<pre><code>recode effort (0/4=1 Weak) (5/14=2 Moderate) (15/max=3 Strong) ///
     , generate(efffortg) label(effortg)</code></pre>
<p>It is often a good idea to cross-tabulate original and recoded
variables to check that the transformation has worked as intended. (Of
course this can only be done if you have generated a new variable!)</p>
<h2 id="s25">2.5 Managing Stata Files</h2>
<p>Once you have created a Stata system file you will want to save it on
disk using <code>save filename, replace</code>, where the replace
option, as usual, is needed only if the file already exists. To load a
Stata file you have saved in a previous session you issue the command
<code>use filename</code>.</p>
<p>If there are temporary variables you do not need in the saved file
you can drop them (before saving) using <code>drop varnames</code>.
Alternatively, you may specify the variables you want to keep, using
<code>keep varnames</code>. With large files you may want to
<code>compress</code> them before saving; this command looks at the data
and stores each variable in the smallest possible data type that will
not result in loss of precision.</p>
<p>It is possible to add variables or observations to a Stata file. To
add <em>variables</em> you use the <code>merge</code> command, which
requires two (or more) Stata files, usually with a common id so
observations can be paired correctly. A typical application is to add
household information to an individual data file. Type
<code>help merge</code> to learn more.</p>
<p>To add <em>observations</em> to a file you use the
<code>append</code> command, which requires the data to be appended to
be on a Stata file, usually containing the same variables as the dataset
in memory. You may, for example, have data for patients in one clinic
and may want to append similar data from another clinic. Type
<code>help append</code> to learn more.</p>
<p>A related but more specialized command is <code>joinby</code>, which
forms all pairwise combinations of observations in memory with
observations in an external dataset (see also <code>cross</code>).</p>
<h2 id="s26">2.6 Data Frames</h2>
<p>Stata 16 introduced <em>frames</em>, which allow it to keep more than
one dataset in memory at the same time. Consider a situation where you
have household and individual data on separate files, both with a common
household id, and need to combine them. In previous versions of Stata
you would have needed to <code>merge</code> the files. Starting with
Stata 16 you can store both datasets as frames, and <em>link</em> the
household data to each individual. Stata 18 lets you save a set of
frames in a single file with extension <code>.dtas</code>, the plural of
<code>.dta</code>. You can then <code>use</code> that file to load the
set of frames into memory. There are many more applications of frames,
type <code>help frames</code> to learn more.</p>

This tutorial is an introduction to Stata emphasizing data management, tables and 
graphics.  A PDF version is available <a href="tutorial.pdf">here</a>. The web 
pages and PDF file were all  generated using the <code>markstat</code> command 
to combine Markdown and Stata, as described <a href="/markstat">here</a>. See 
also the computing logs for the statistics courses on this site.</small></div>
<h1 class="first" id="s1">1 Introduction</h1>
<p>Stata is a powerful statistical package with smart data-management
facilities, a wide array of up-to-date statistical techniques, and an
excellent system for producing publication-quality tables and graphs.
Stata is fast and easy to use. In this tutorial I start with a quick
introduction and overview, and then discuss data management, tables of
various types, statistical graphs, and Stata programming.</p>
<p><img src="icon18.png" align="left" style="padding:7px 7px 0 0"/> The
tutorial has been updated for version 18, but most of the discussion
applies to older versions as well. An important exception is Section 3
on Stata Tables, which describes a set a commands for producing
customizable tables introduced in version 17, with a new command in
version 18. A few other features added in recent versions will be noted
along the way.</p>
<h2 id="s11">1.1 A Quick Tour of Stata</h2>
<p>Stata is available for Windows, Mac, and Unix computers. This
tutorial was created using the Windows version, but all the code shown
here runs in all three platforms. There are three editions: (1)
Stata/BE, the basic edition (formerly intercooled), suitable for
mid-size datasets with up to 2048 variables, (2) Stata/SE, the standard
edition (formerly special edition), it can handle up to 32,766 variables
as well as longer strings and matrices, and (3) Stata/MP, an edition for
multicore/multiprocessor computers that allows processing very large
datasets and is substantially faster. (The first two designations
changed with Stata 17.) The number of observations is limited by your
computer’s memory, as long as it doesn’t exceed about two billion in
Stata/SE and about a trillion in Stata/MP. Starting with version 16
Stata can be installed on 64-bit computers only; previous versions were
available for both older 32-bit and newer 64-bit computers. All of these
versions can read each other’s files within their size limits.</p>
<h3 id="the-stata-interface">1.1.1 The Stata Interface</h3>
<p>When Stata starts up you see five docked windows, initially arranged
as shown in the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="stata18.png" class="img-responsive center-block"/> </p>
<p>The window labeled <em>Command</em> is where you type your commands.
Stata then shows the results in the larger window immediately above,
called appropriately enough <em>Results</em>. Your command is added to a
list in the window labeled <em>History</em> on the left (called
<em>Review</em> in earlier versions), so you can keep track of the
commands you have used. The window labeled <em>Variables</em>, on the
top right, lists the variables in your dataset. The <em>Properties</em>
window immediately below that, introduced in version 12, displays
properties of your variables and dataset.</p>
<p>You can resize or even close some of these windows. Stata remembers
its settings the next time it runs. You can also save (and then load)
named preference sets using the menu <u>E</u>dit|<u>P</u>references. I
happen to like the Compact Window Layout. You can also choose the font
used in each window, just right click and select font from the context
menu. Finally, it is possible to change the color scheme under General
Preferences. You can select one of four overall color schemes: light,
light gray, blue or dark. You can also choose one of several preset or
customizable styles for the Results and Viewer windows.</p>
<p>There are other windows that we will discuss as needed, namely the
<em>Graph</em>, <em>Viewer</em>, <em>Variables Manager</em>, <em>Data
Editor,</em> and <em>Do file Editor</em>.</p>
<p>Starting with version 8 Stata’s graphical user interface (GUI) allows
selecting commands and options from a menu and dialog system. However, I
strongly recommend using the command language as a way to ensure
reproducibility of your results. In fact, I recommend that you type your
commands on a separate file, called a do file, as explained in Section
1.2 below, but for now we will just type in the command window. The GUI
can be helpful when you are starting to learn Stata, particularly
because after you point and click on the menus and dialogs, Stata types
the corresponding command for you.</p>
<h3 id="typing-commands">1.1.2 Typing Commands</h3>
<p>Stata can work as a calculator using the <code><u>d</u>isplay</code>
command. Try typing the following (you may skip the dot at the start of
a line, which is how Stata marks the lines you type):</p>
<pre class='stata'>.  display 2+2 
4

.  display 2 * ttail(20, 2.1) 
.04861759
</pre>
<p>Stata commands are case-sensitive, <code>display</code> is not the
same as <code>Display</code> and the latter will <em>not</em> work.
Commands can also be abbreviated; the documentation and online help
underlines the shortest legal abbreviation of each command, and we will
do the same here.</p>
<p>The second command shows the use of a built-in function to compute a
p-value, in this case twice the probability that a Student’s t with 20
d.f. exceeds 2.1. This result would just make the 5% cutoff. To find the
two-tailed 5% critical value try
<code>display invttail(20, 0.025)</code>. We list a few other functions
you can use in Section 2.</p>
<p>If you issue a command and discover that it doesn’t work, press the
Page Up key to recall it (you can cycle through your command history
using the Page Up and Page Down keys) and then edit it using the arrow,
insert and delete keys, which work exactly as you would expect. For
example the Arrow keys advance a character at a time, combined with the
Shift key they select a character at a time, and combined with the Ctlr
or Option key they advance or select a word at a time, which you can
then delete or replace. A command can be as long as needed (up to some
64k characters); in an interactive session you just keep on typing and
the command window will wrap and scroll as needed.</p>
<h3 id="getting-help">1.1.3 Getting Help</h3>
<p>Stata has excellent online help. To obtain help on a command (or
function) type <code>help command_name</code>, which displays the help
on a separate window called the <em>Viewer</em>. Try
<code>help ttail</code>. Each help file appears in a separate viewer tab
(a separate window before Stata 12) unless you use the option
<code>, nonew</code>.</p>
<p>If you don’t know the name of the command you need, you can search
for it. Stata has a <code>search</code> command that will search the
documentation and other resources, type <code>help search</code> to
learn more. By default this command searches the net in Stata 13 and
later. If you are using an earlier version, learn about the
<code>findit</code> command. Also, the <code>help</code> command reverts
to a search if the argument is not recognized as a command. Try
<code>help Student's t</code>. This will list all Stata commands and
functions related to the t distribution. Among the list of “Stat
functions” you will see <code>t()</code> for the distribution function
and <code>ttail()</code> for right-tail probabilities. Stata can also
compute tail probabilities for the normal, chi-squared and F
distributions, among others.</p>
<p>One of the nicest features of Stata is that, starting with version
11, all the documentation is available in PDF files. (In fact, since
version 13 you can no longer get printed manuals.) Moreover, these files
are linked from the online help, so you can jump directly to the
relevant section of the manual. To learn more about the help system type
<code>help help</code>.</p>
<h3 id="loading-a-sample-data-file">1.1.4 Loading a Sample Data
File</h3>
<p>Stata comes with a few sample data files. You will learn how to read
your own data into Stata in Section 2, but for now we will load one of
the sample files, namely <code>lifeexp.dta</code>, which has data on
life expectancy and gross national product (GNP) per capita in 1998 for
68 countries. To see a list of the files shipped with Stata type
<code>sysuse dir</code>. To load the file we want type
<code>sysuse lifeexp</code> (the file extension is optional, so I left
it out). To see what’s in the file type <code><u>d</u>escribe</code>,.
(This can be abbreviated to a single letter, but I prefer
<code>desc</code>.)</p>
<pre class='stata'>. sysuse lifeexp, clear

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

</pre>
<p>We see that we have six variables. The dataset has notes that you can
see by typing <code>notes</code>. Four of the variables have annotations
that you can see by typing <code>notes varname</code>. You’ll learn how
to add notes in Section 2.</p>
<h3 id="descriptive-statistics">1.1.5 Descriptive Statistics</h3>
<p>Let us run simple descriptive statistics for the two variables we are
interested in, using the <code><u>s</u>ummarize</code> command followed
by the names of the variables:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. summarize lexp gnppc

    Variable │        Obs        Mean    Std. dev.       Min        Max
─────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        lexp │         68    72.27941    4.715315         54         79
       gnppc │         63    8674.857    10634.68        370      39980
</pre>
<p>We see that live expectancy averages 72.3 years and GNP per capita
ranges from $370 to $39,980 with an average of $8,675. We also see that
Stata reports only 63 observations on GNP per capita, so we must have
some missing values. Let us <code>list</code> the countries for which we
are missing GNP per capita:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. list country gnppc if missing(gnppc)

     ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
     │                      country   gnppc │
     ├──────────────────────────────────────┤
  7. │       Bosnia and Herzegovina       . │
 40. │                 Turkmenistan       . │
 44. │ Yugoslavia, FR (Serb./Mont.)       . │
 46. │                         Cuba       . │
 56. │                  Puerto Rico       . │
     └──────────────────────────────────────┘
</pre>
<p>We see that we have indeed five missing values. This example
illustrates a powerful feature of Stata: the action of any command can
be restricted to a subset of the data. If we had typed
<code>list country gnppc</code> we would have listed these variables for
all 68 countries. Adding the <em>condition</em>
<code>if missing(gnppc)</code> restricts the list to cases where
<code>gnppc</code> is missing. Note that Stata lists missing values
using a dot. We’ll learn more about missing values in Section 2.</p>
<h3 id="drawing-a-scatterplot">1.1.6 Drawing a Scatterplot</h3>
<p>To see how life expectancy varies with GNP per capita we will draw a
scatter plot using the <code>graph</code> command, which has a myriad of
subcommands and options, some of which we describe in Section 4.</p>
<pre class='stata'>. graph twoway scatter lexp gnppc

. graph export scatter.png, width(550) replace
file scatter.png saved as PNG format
</pre>
<p><img src="scatter.png" class="img-responsive center-block" /></p>
<p>The plot shows a curvilinear relationship between GNP per capita and
life expectancy. We will see if the relationship can be linearized by
taking the log of GNP per capita.</p>
<h3 id="computing-new-variables">1.1.7 Computing New Variables</h3>
<p>We compute a new variable using the <code><u>g</u>enerate</code>
command with a new variable name and an arithmetic expression. Choosing
good variable names is important. When computing logs I usually just
prefix the old variable name with <code>log</code> or <code>l</code>,
but compound names can easily become cryptic and hard-to-read. Some
programmers separate words using an underscore, as in
<code>log_gnp_pc</code>, and others prefer the camel-casing convention
which capitalizes each word after the first: <code>logGnpPc</code>. I
suggest you develop a consistent style and stick to it. Variable labels
can also help, as described in Section 2.</p>
<p>To compute natural logs we use the built-in function
<code>log</code>:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. gen loggnppc = log(gnppc)
(5 missing values generated)
</pre>
<p>Stata says it has generated five missing values. These correspond to
the five countries for which we were missing GNP per capita. Try to
confirm this statement using the list command. We will learn more about
generating new variables in Section 2.</p>
<h3 id="simple-linear-regression">1.1.8 Simple Linear Regression</h3>
<p>We are now ready to run a linear regression of life expectancy on log
GNP per capita. We will use the <code><u>reg</u>ress</code> command,
which lists the outcome followed by the predictors (here just one,
<code>loggnppc</code>)</p>
<pre class='stata'>. regress lexp loggnppc

      Source │       SS           df       MS      Number of obs   =        63
─────────────┼──────────────────────────────────   F(1, 61)        =     97.09
       Model │  873.264865         1  873.264865   Prob > F        =    0.0000
    Residual │  548.671643        61  8.99461709   R-squared       =    0.6141
─────────────┼──────────────────────────────────   Adj R-squared   =    0.6078
       Total │  1421.93651        62  22.9344598   Root MSE        =    2.9991

─────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        lexp │ Coefficient  Std. err.      t    P>|t|     [95% conf. interval]
─────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    loggnppc │   2.768349   .2809566     9.85   0.000     2.206542    3.330157
       _cons │   49.41502   2.348494    21.04   0.000     44.71892    54.11113
─────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
</pre>
<p>Note that the regression is based on only 63 observations. Stata
omits observations that are missing the outcome or one of the
predictors. The log of GNP per capita accounts for 61% of the variation
in life expectancy in these countries. We also see that a one percent
increase in GNP per capita is associated with an increase of 0.0277
years in life expectancy. (To see this point note that if GNP increases
by one percent its log increases by 0.01.)</p>
<p>Following a regression (or in fact any estimation command) you can
retype the command with no arguments to see the results again. Try
typing <code>reg</code>.</p>
<h3 id="post-estimation-commands">1.1.9 Post-Estimation Commands</h3>
<p>Stata has a number of post-estimation commands that build on the
results of a model fit. A useful command is <code>predict</code>, which
can be used to generate fitted values or residuals following a
regression. The command</p>
<pre class='stata'>. predict plexp
(option xb assumed; fitted values)
(5 missing values generated)
</pre>
<p>generates a new variable, <code>plexp</code>, that has the life
expectancy predicted from our regression equation. No predictions are
made for the five countries without GNP per capita. (If life expectancy
was missing for a country it would be excluded from the regression, but
a prediction would be made for it. This technique can be used to fill-in
missing values.)</p>
<h3 id="plotting-the-data-and-a-linear-fit">1.1.10 Plotting the Data and
a Linear Fit</h3>
<p>A common task is to superimpose a regression line on a scatter plot
to inspect the quality of the fit. We could do this using the
predictions we stored in <code>plexp</code>, but Stata’s
<code>graph</code> command knows how to do linear fits on the fly, using
the <code>lfit</code> plot type, and can superimpose different types of
<code>twoway</code> plots, as explained in more detail in Section 4. Try
the command</p>
<pre class='stata'>. graph twoway (scatter lexp loggnppc) (lfit lexp loggnppc)

. graph export fit.png, width(550) replace
file fit.png saved as PNG format
</pre>
<p><img src="fit.png" class="img-responsive center-block" /></p>
<p>In this command each expression in parenthesis is a separate two-way
plot to be overlayed in the same graph. The fit looks reasonably good,
except for a possible outlier.</p>
<h3 id="listing-selected-observations">1.1.11 Listing Selected
Observations</h3>
<p>It’s hard not to notice the country on the bottom left of the graph,
which has much lower life expectancy than one would expect, even given
its low GNP per capita. To find which country it is we list the (names
of the) countries where life expectancy is less than 55:</p>
<pre class='stata'>. list country lexp plexp if lexp &lt; 55, clean

       country   lexp      plexp  
 50.     Haiti     54   66.06985  
</pre>
<p>We find that the outlier is Haiti, with a life expectancy 12 years
less than one would expect given its GNP per capita. (The keyword
<code>clean</code> after the comma is an <em>option</em> which omits the
borders on the listing. Many Stata commands have options, and these are
always specified after a comma.) If you are curious where the United
States is try</p>
<pre class='stata'>. list gnppc loggnppc lexp plexp if country == "United States", clean

       gnppc   loggnppc   lexp      plexp  
 58.   29240   10.28329     77   77.88277  
</pre>
<p>Here we restricted the listing to cases where the value of the
variable <code>country</code> was “United States”. Note the use of a
double equal sign in a logical expression. In Stata <code>x = 2</code>
assigns the value 2 to the variable <code>x</code>, whereas
<code>x == 2</code> checks to see if the value of <code>x</code> is
2.</p>
<h3 id="saving-your-work-and-exiting-stata">1.1.12 Saving your Work and
Exiting Stata</h3>
<p>To exit Stata you use the <code>exit</code> command. (You can also
use a shortcut or the menu system, type <code>help exit</code> for
details for your operating system.) If you have been following along
this tutorial by typing the commands and try to exit Stata will refuse,
saying “no; data in memory would be lost”. This happens because we have
added a new variable that is not part of the original dataset, and it
hasn’t been saved. As you can see, Stata is very careful to ensure we
don’t loose our work.</p>
<p>If you don’t care about saving anything you can type
<code>exit, clear</code>, which tells Stata to quit no matter what.
Alternatively, you can save the data to disk using the
<code>save filename</code> command, and then exit. A cautious programmer
will <em>always</em> save a modified file using a new name.</p>
<h2 id="s12">1.2 Using Stata Effectively</h2>
<p>While it is fun to type commands interactively and see the results
straightaway, serious work requires that you save your results and keep
track of the commands that you have used, so that you can document your
work and reproduce it later if needed. Here are some practical
recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-project-directory">1.2.1 Create a Project
Directory</h3>
<p>Stata reads and saves data from the current working directory, which
you can display using the command <code>pwd</code>, short for print
working directory. You can change directory using the command
<code>cd</code> <em><code>directory_name</code></em>, where the
directory name follows the conventions of your operating system,
including an optional drive letter on Windows. Type <code>help cd</code>
to learn more. I recommend that you create a separate directory for each
course or research project you are involved in, and start your Stata
session by changing to that directory.</p>
<p>Stata has other commands for interacting with the operating system,
including <code>mkdir</code> to create a directory, <code>dir</code> to
list the names of the files in a directory, <code>type</code> to list
their contents, <code>copy</code> to copy files, and <code>erase</code>
to delete a file. You can (and probably should) do these tasks using the
operating system directly, but the Stata commands may come handy if you
want to write a script to perform repetitive tasks.</p>
<h3 id="open-a-log-file">1.2.2 Open a Log File</h3>
<p>So far all our output has gone to the <em>Results</em> window, where
it can be viewed but eventually disappears. (You can control how far you
can scroll back, type <code>help scrollbufsize</code> to learn more.) To
keep a <em>permanent</em> record of your results, however, you should
<code>log</code> your session. When you open a log, Stata writes all
results to both the <em>Results</em> window and to the file you specify.
To open a log file use the command</p>
<pre><code>log using filename, text replace</code></pre>
<p>where <em>filename</em> is the name of your log file. Note the use of
two recommended options: <code>text</code> and <code>replace</code>.</p>
<p>By default the log is written using SMCL, Stata Markup and Control
Language (pronounced “smickle”), which provides some formatting
facilities but can only be viewed using Stata’s <em>Viewer</em>.
Fortunately, there is a <code>text</code> option to create logs in plain
text format, which can be viewed in a text editor or a word processor.
(An alternative is to create your log in SMCL and then use the
<code>translate</code> command to convert it to plain text, postscript,
or even PDF, type <code>help translate</code> to learn more about this
option.)</p>
<p>The <code>replace</code> option specifies that the file is to be
overwritten if it already exists. This will often be the case if (like
me) you need to run your commands several times to get them right. In
fact, if an earlier run has failed it is likely that you have a log file
open, in which case the <code>log</code> command will fail. The solution
is to close any open logs using the <code>log close</code> command. The
problem with this solution is that it will not work if there is no log
open! The way out of the catch 22 is to use</p>
<pre><code>capture log close</code></pre>
<p>The <code>capture</code> keyword tells Stata to run the command that
follows and ignore any errors. Use judiciously!</p>
<h3 id="always-use-a-do-file">1.2.3 Always Use a Do File</h3>
<p>A do file is just a set of Stata commands typed in a plain text file.
You can use Stata’s own built-in <em>do-file editor</em>, which has the
great advantage that you can run your code directly from the editor
using the shortcut <code>Ctrl-D</code> or <code>Cmd-D</code> or the run
icon, which do their job smartly: if you have selected some text Stata
will extend the selection to include complete lines and will then run
them; if there is no selection Stata will run the entire script. The
editor can be activated with the <code>doedit</code> command, the
shortcut <code>Ctrl-9</code> or <code>Cmd-9</code>, or an icon on the
GUI.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use any text or code editor. Save the file
using the extension <code>.do</code> and then execute it using the
command <code>do</code> <em><code>filename</code></em>. For a thorough
discussion of alternative text editors see <a
href="http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/t/textEditors.html"
class="uri">http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/t/textEditors.html</a>, a
page maintained by Nicholas J. Cox, of the University of Durham.</p>
<p>You could even use a word processor such as Word, but you would have
to remember to save the file in plain text format, not in Word document
format. Also, you may find Word’s insistence on capitalizing the first
word on each line annoying when you are trying to type Stata commands
that must be in lowercase. You can, of course, turn auto-correct off.
But it’s a lot easier to just use a plain-text editor.</p>
<h3 id="use-comments-and-annotations">1.2.4 Use Comments and
Annotations</h3>
<p>Code that looks obvious to you may not be so obvious to a co-worker,
or even to you a few months later. It is always a good idea to annotate
your do files with explanatory comments that provide the gist of what
you are trying to do.</p>
<p>In the Stata command window you can <em>start</em> a line with a
<code>*</code> to indicate that it is a comment, not a command. This can
be useful to annotate your output.</p>
<p>In a do file you can also use two other types of comments:
<code>//</code> and <code>/*  */</code>.</p>
<p><code>//</code> is used to indicate that everything that
<em>follows</em> to the end of the line is a comment and should be
ignored by Stata. For example you could write</p>
<pre><code>gen one = 1 // this will serve as a constant in the model</code></pre>
<p><code>/* */</code> is used to indicate that all the text
<em>between</em> the opening <code>/*</code> and the closing
<code>*/</code>, which may be a few characters or may span several
lines, is a comment to be ignored by Stata. This type of comment can be
used anywhere, even in the middle of a line, and is sometimes used to
“comment out” code.</p>
<p>There is a third type of comment used to break very long lines, as
explained in the next subsection. Type <code>help comments</code> to
learn more about comments.</p>
<p>It is always a good idea to start every do file with comments that
include at least a title, the name of the programmer who wrote the file,
and the date. Assumptions about required files should also be noted.</p>
<h3 id="continuation-lines">1.2.5 Continuation Lines</h3>
<p>When you are typing on the command window a command can be as long as
needed. In a do-file you will probably want to break long commands into
lines to improve readability.</p>
<p>To indicate to Stata that a command continues on the next line you
use <code>///</code>, which says that everything else to the end of the
line is a comment <em>and</em> the command itself continues on the next
line. For example you could write</p>
<pre><code>graph twoway  (scatter lexp loggnppc) ///
              (lfit lexp loggnppc)</code></pre>
<p>Old hands might write</p>
<pre><code>graph twoway (scatter lexp loggnppc) /*
 */          (lfit lexp loggnppc)</code></pre>
<p>which “comments out” the end of the line.</p>
<p>An alternative is to tell Stata to use a semi-colon instead of the
carriage return at the end of the line to mark the end of a command,
using <code>#delimit ;</code>, as in this example:</p>
<pre><code>#delimit ;
graph twoway (scatter lexp loggnppc) 
             (lfit lexp loggnppc) ;</code></pre>
<p>Now all commands need to terminate with a semi-colon. To return to
using <u>c</u>arriage <u>r</u>eturn as the delimiter use</p>
<pre><code>#delimit cr</code></pre>
<p>The delimiter can only be changed in do files. But then you always
use do files, right?</p>
<h3 id="a-sample-do-file">1.2.6 A Sample Do File</h3>
<p>Here’s a simple do file that can reproduce all the results in our
Quick Tour. The file doesn’t have many comments because this page has
all the details. Following the listing we comment on a couple of lines
that require explanation.</p>
<pre><code>// A Quick Tour of Stata

<p>We start the do file by specifying the version of Stata that we are
using, in this case 18. This helps ensure that future versions of Stata
will continue to interpret the commands correctly, even if Stata has
changed, see <code>help version</code> for details. (The previous
version of this file read version 17, and I could have left that in
place to run under version control; the results would be the same
because none of the commands used in this quick tour has changed.)</p>
<p>The <code>clear</code> statement deletes the data currently held in
memory and any value labels you might have. We need <code>clear</code>
just in case we need to rerun the program, as the <code>sysuse</code>
command would then fail because we already have a dataset in memory and
we have not saved it. An alternative with the same effect is to type
<code>sysuse lifeexp, clear</code>. (Stata keeps other objects in memory
as well, including saved results, scalars and matrices, although we
haven’t had occasion to use these yet. Typing <code>clear all</code>
removes these objects from memory, ensuring that you start with a
completely clean slate. See <code>help clear</code> for more
information. Usually, however, all you need to do is clear the
data.)</p>
<p>Note also that we use a <code>graph export</code> command to convert
the graph in memory to Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, ready for
inclusion in a web page. We discuss other graph formats in Section
4.</p>
<h3 id="stata-command-syntax">1.2.7 Stata Command Syntax</h3>
<p>Having used a few Stata commands it may be time to comment briefly on
their structure, which usually follows the following syntax, where bold
indicates keywords and square brackets indicate optional elements:</p>
<p>[<strong>by</strong> <em>varlist</em><strong>:</strong>]
<em>command</em> [<em>varlist</em>] [<strong>=</strong><em>exp</em>]
[<strong>if</strong> <em>exp</em>] [<strong>in</strong> <em>range</em>]
[<em>weight</em>] [<strong>using</strong> <em>filename</em>]
[<strong>,</strong><em>options</em>]</p>
<p>We now describe each syntax element:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em><code>command</code></em>:</dt>
<dd>
The only required element is the command itself, which is usually (but
not always) an action verb, and is often followed by the names of one or
more variables. Stata commands are case-sensitive. The commands
<code>describe</code> and <code>Describe</code> are different, and only
the former will work. Commands can usually be abbreviated as noted
earlier. When we introduce a command we underline the letters that are
required. For example <code><u>reg</u>ress</code> indicates that the
<code>regress</code> command can be abbreviated to <code>reg</code>.
</dd>
<dt><em><code>varlist</code></em>:</dt>
<dd>
The command is often followed by the names of one or more variables, for
example <code>describe lexp</code> or
<code>regress lexp loggnppc</code>. Variable names are case sensitive;
<code>lexp</code> and <code>LEXP</code> are different variables. A
variable name can be abbreviated to the minimum number of letters that
makes it unique in a dataset. For example in our quick tour we could
refer to <code>loggnppc</code> as <code>log</code> because it is the
only variable that begins with those three letters, but this is a really
bad idea. Abbreviations that are unique may become ambiguous as you
create new variables, so you have to be very careful. You can also use
wildcards such as <code>v*</code> or name ranges, such as
<code>v101-v105</code> to refer to several variables. Type
<code>help varlist</code> to learn more about variable lists.
</dd>
<dt><em><code>=exp</code></em>:</dt>
<dd>
Commands used to generate new variables, such as
<code>generate log_gnp = log(gnp)</code>, include an arithmetic
expression, basically a formula using the standard operators (+ - * and
/ for the four basic operations and ^ for exponentiation, so 3^2 is
three squared), functions, and parentheses. We discuss expressions in
Section 2.
</dd>
<dt><strong><code>if</code></strong> <em><code>exp</code></em> and
<strong><code>in</code></strong> <em><code>range</code></em>:</dt>
<dd>
As we have seen, a command’s action can be restricted to a subset of the
data by specifying a logical condition that evaluates to true or false,
such as <code>lexp &lt; 55</code>. Relational operators are &lt;, &lt;=,
==, &gt;= and &gt;, and logical negation is expressed using
<code>!</code> or <code>~</code>, as we will see in Section 2.
Alternatively, you can specify a range of the data, for example
<code>in 1/10</code> will restrict the command’s action to the first 10
observations. Type <code>help numlist</code> to learn more about lists
of numbers.
</dd>
<dt><em><code>weight</code></em>:</dt>
<dd>
Some commands allow the use of weights, type <code>help weights</code>
to learn more.
</dd>
<dt><strong><code>using</code></strong>
<em><code>filename</code></em>:</dt>
<dd>
The keyword <code>using</code> introduces a file name; this can be a
file in your computer, on the network, or on the internet, as you will
see when we discuss data input in Section 2.
</dd>
<dt><em><code>options</code></em>:</dt>
<dd>
Most commands have <em><code>options</code></em> that are specified
following a comma. To obtain a list of the options available with a
command type <code>help command</code>. where <code>command</code> is
the actual command name.
</dd>
<dt><strong><code>by</code></strong> <em><code>varlist</code></em>:</dt>
<dd>
A very powerful feature, it instructs Stata to <em>repeat</em> the
command for each group of observations defined by distinct values of the
variables in the list. For this to work the command must be “byable” (as
noted on the online help) and the data must be sorted by the grouping
variable(s) (or use <code>bysort</code> instead).
</dd>

<h2 id="s13">1.3 Stata Resources</h2>
<p>There are many resources available to learn more about Stata, both
online and in print.</p>
<h3 id="online-resources">1.3.1 Online Resources</h3>
<p>Stata has an excellent website at <a
href="https://www.stata.com/">https://www.stata.com</a>. Among other
things you will find that they make available online all datasets used
in the official documentation, that they publish a journal called The
<em>Stata Journal</em>, and that they have an excellent bookstore with
texts on Stata and related statistical subjects. Stata also offers email
and web-based training courses called NetCourses, see <a
href="https://www.stata.com/netcourse/"
class="uri">https://www.stata.com/netcourse/</a>.</p>
<p>There is a Stata forum where you can post questions and receive
prompt and knowledgeable answers from other users, quite often from the
indefatigable and extremely knowledgeable Nicholas Cox, who deserves
special recognition for his service to the user community. The list was
started by Marcello Pagano at the Harvard School of Public Health, and
is now maintained by StataCorp, see <a href="https://www.statalist.org"
class="uri">https://www.statalist.org</a> for more information,
including how to participate. Stata also maintains a list of frequently
asked questions (FAQ) classified by topic, see <a
href="https://www.stata.com/support/faqs/"

<p>UCLA maintains an excellent Stata portal at <a
href="https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stata/"
class="uri">https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stata/</a>, with many useful
links, including a list of resources to help you learn and stay
up-to-date with Stata, including classes and seminars, learning modules
and useful links, not to mention comparisons with other packages such as
SAS and SPSS.</p>
<h3 id="manuals-and-books">1.3.2 Manuals and Books</h3>
<p><img src="docs18.png" align="left" class="img-responsive pull-left" style="padding-right:14px">
The Stata documentation has been growing with each version and now
consists of 33 volumes with more than 18,000 pages, all available in PDF
format with your copy of Stata. Here is a list, with italics indicating
two new and one renamed manual in Stata 18. The basic documentation
consists of a Base Reference Manual, separate volumes on Data
Management, Graphics, Customizable Tables and Collected Results,
Reporting, and Functions; a User’s Guide, an Index, and Getting Started
with Stata, which has platform-specific versions for Windows, Mac and
Unix. Some statistical subjects that may be important to you are
described in 21 separate manuals: <em>Adaptive Designs: Group Sequential
Trials</em>, Bayesian Analysis, <em>Bayesian Model Averaging</em>,
<em>Causal Inference and Treatment-Effects Estimation</em>, Choice
Models, Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Models, Extended
Regression Models, Finite Mixture Models, Item Response Theory, Lasso,
Longitudinal Data/Panel Data, Meta Analysis, Multilevel Mixed Effects,
Multiple Imputation, Multivariate Statistics; Power, Precision and
Sample Size; Spatial Autoregressive Models, Structural Equation
Modeling, Survey Data, Survival Analysis, and Time Series. Additional
volumes of interest to programmers, particularly those seeking to extend
Stata’s capabilities, are manuals on Programming and on Mata, Stata’s
matrix programming language. You can access all of these manuals from
the help system or at <a
href="https://www.stata.com/features/documentation/"
class="uri">https://www.stata.com/features/documentation/</a>.</p>
<p>A good introduction to Stata is Alan C. Acock’s <em>A Gentle
Introduction to Stata</em>, now in a revised 6th edition. One of my
favorite statistical modeling books is Scott Long and Jeremy Freese’s
<em>Regression Models for Categorical Dependent Variables Using
Stata</em> (3rd edition); Section 2.10 of this book is a set of
recommended practices that should be read and followed faithfully by
every aspiring Stata data analyst. Another book I like is Michael
Mitchell’s excellent <em>A Visual Guide to Stata Graphics</em>, which
was written specially to introduce the new graphs in version 8 and is
now in its 4th edition. Two useful (but more specialized) references
written by the developers of Stata are <em>An Introduction to Survival
Analysis Using Stata</em> (revised 3rd edition), by Mario Cleves,
William Gould and Julia Marchenko, and <em>Maximum Likelihood Estimation
with Stata</em> (4th edition) by William Gould, Jeffrey Pitblado, and
Brian Poi. Readers interested in programming Stata will find Christopher
F. Baum’s <em>An Introduction to Stata Programming</em> (2nd edition),
and William Gould’s <em>The Mata Book: A Book for Serious Programmers
and Those Who Want to Be</em>, both invaluable.</p>
